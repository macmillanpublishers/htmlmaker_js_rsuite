Do you understand this feeling? This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards which I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes. Inspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent and vivid. I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of frost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the region of beauty and delight. There, Margaret, the sun is forever visible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a perpetual splendour. There&#x2014;for with your leave, my sister, I will put some trust in preceding navigators&#x2014;there snow and frost are banished; and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable globe. Its productions and features may be without example, as the phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered solitudes.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id15tvwj86h"/><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idx3jbpa3rf"/></section><section data-type="foreword" id="sectid6ed59" class=""><header><h1>Foreword</h1></header><h1 class="Main-HeadMHead" id="idjcedin2tr">Foreword by Robert Walton</h1><p class="Author1Au1" id="idqpfukd9su">Robert Walton</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idmrwrhvk5u">How slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am by frost and snow! Yet a second step is taken towards my enterprise. I have hired a vessel and am occupied in collecting my sailors; those whom I have already engaged appear to be men on whom I can depend and are certainly possessed of dauntless courage.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddwv07znli">But I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy, and the absence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil, I have no friend, Margaret: when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success, there will be none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by disappointment, no one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection. I shall commit my thoughts to paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium for the communication of feeling. I desire the company of a man who could sympathize with me, whose eyes would reply to mine. You may deem me romantic, my dear sister, but I bitterly feel the want of a friend. I have no one near me, gentle yet courageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whose tastes are like my own, to approve or amend my plans. How would such a friend repair the faults of your poor brother! I am too ardent in execution and too impatient of difficulties. But it is a still greater evil to me that I am self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild on a common and read nothing but our Uncle Thomas&apos; books of voyages. At that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own country; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its most important benefits from such a conviction that I perceived the necessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native country. Now I am twenty-eight and am in reality more illiterate than many schoolboys of fifteen. It is true that I have thought more and that my daydreams are more extended and magnificent, but they want (as the painters call it) KEEPING; and I greatly need a friend who would have sense enough not to despise me as romantic, and affection enough for me to endeavour to regulate my mind. Well, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on the wide ocean, nor even here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen. Yet some feelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in these rugged bosoms. My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful courage and enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or rather, to word my phrase more characteristically, of advancement in his profession. He is an Englishman, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices, unsoftened by cultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of humanity. I first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel; finding that he was unemployed in this city, I easily engaged him to assist in my enterprise. The master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the ship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline. This circumstance, added to his well-known integrity and dauntless courage, made me very desirous to engage him. A youth passed in solitude, my best years spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the groundwork of my character that I cannot overcome an intense distaste to the usual brutality exercised on board ship: I have never believed it to be necessary, and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness of heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, I felt myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services. I heard of him first in rather a romantic manner, from a lady who owes to him the happiness of her life. This, briefly, is his story. Some years ago he loved a young Russian lady of moderate fortune, and having amassed a considerable sum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to the match. He saw his mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in tears, and throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her, confessing at the same time that she loved another, but that he was poor, and that her father would never consent to the union. My generous friend reassured the suppliant, and on being informed of the name of her lover, instantly abandoned his pursuit. He had already bought a farm with his money, on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he bestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains of his prize-money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the young woman&apos;s father to consent to her marriage with her lover. But the old man decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my friend, who, when he found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor returned until he heard that his former mistress was married according to her inclinations. &quot;What a noble fellow!&quot; you will exclaim. He is so; but then he is wholly uneducated: he is as silent as a Turk, and a kind of ignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his conduct the more astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy which otherwise he would command.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idt8efymp6o">Yet do not suppose, because I complain a little or because I can conceive a consolation for my toils which I may never know, that I am wavering in my resolutions. Those are as fixed as fate, and my voyage is only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation. The winter has been dreadfully severe, but the spring promises well, and it is considered as a remarkably early season, so that perhaps I may sail sooner than I expected. I shall do nothing rashly: you know me sufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the safety of others is committed to my care.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idc4rot2p04">I cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my undertaking. It is impossible to communicate to you a conception of the trembling sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with which I am preparing to depart. I am going to unexplored regions, to &quot;the land of mist and snow,&quot; but I shall kill no albatross; therefore do not be alarmed for my safety or if I should come back to you as worn and woeful as the &quot;Ancient Mariner.&quot; You will smile at my allusion, but I will disclose a secret. I have often attributed my attachment to, my passionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that production of the most imaginative of modern poets. There is something at work in my soul which I do not understand. I am practically industrious&#x2014;painstaking, a workman to execute with perseverance and labour&#x2014;but besides this there is a love for the marvellous, a belief in the marvellous, intertwined in all my projects, which hurries me out of the common pathways of men, even to the wild sea and unvisited regions I am about to explore. But to return to dearer considerations. Shall I meet you again, after having traversed immense seas, and returned by the most southern cape of Africa or America? I dare not expect such success, yet I cannot bear to look on the reverse of the picture. Continue for the present to write to me by every opportunity: I may receive your letters on some occasions when I need them most to support my spirits. I love you very tenderly. Remember me with affection, should you never hear from me again.</p><p class="ClosingClos" id="idpx46su1f2">Your affectionate brother, Robert Walton</p><p class="SignatureSig" id="idry6ezks4l">R.W.</p><p class="SignatureSig" id="idajz49o8o3">August 2016</p><p class="Ebook-Only-TextEonly" id="idgo5lniif6">Rober Walton Website</p><p class="Ebook-Only-TextEonly" id="ida2xrhomxv">www.gutenberg.org</p></section><section data-type="introduction" id="sectidd0vh10" class=""><header><h1>Introduction</h1></header><h1 class="TitleTtl" id="id7bq4rqdyv">Introduction</h1><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idnfe00hi9j">I am by birth a Genevese, and my family is one of the most distinguished of that republic. My ancestors had been for many years counsellors and syndics, and my father had filled several public situations with honour and reputation. He was respected by all who knew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public business. He passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the affairs of his country; a variety of circumstances had prevented his marrying early, nor was it until the decline of life that he became a husband and the father of a family.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idoqz23ufk5">As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot refrain from relating them. One of his most intimate friends was a merchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous mischances, into poverty. This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a proud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been distinguished for his rank and magnificence. Having paid his debts, therefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his daughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in wretchedness. My father loved Beaufort with the truest friendship and was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances. He bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct so little worthy of the affection that united them. He lost no time in endeavouring to seek him out, with the hope of persuading him to begin the world again through his credit and assistance.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idw2mx4e3s4">Beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself, and it was ten months before my father discovered his abode. Overjoyed at this discovery, he hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean street near the Reuss. But when he entered, misery and despair alone welcomed him. <span class="itali">Beaufort had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes</span>, but it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months, and in the meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a merchant&apos;s house. The interval was, consequently, spent in inaction; his grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for reflection, and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end of three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1zpj3iiwg">His daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness, but she saw with despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that there was no other prospect of support. But Caroline Beaufort possessed a mind of an uncommon mould, and her courage rose to support her in her adversity. She procured plain work; she plaited straw and by various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to support life.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddxwlsleuw">Several months passed in this manner. Her father grew worse; her time was more entirely occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence decreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving her an orphan and a beggar. This last blow overcame her, and she knelt by Beaufort&apos;s coffin weeping bitterly, when my father entered the chamber. He came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl, who committed herself to his care; and after the interment of his friend he conducted her to Geneva and placed her under the protection of a relation. Two years after this event Caroline became his wife.</p><p class="Ornamental-Space-BreakOsbrk" id="idmqkjdep6v">***</p><p class="Bookmaker-Processing-InstructionBpi" id="idh2t5n3typ">IMAGE: wildcards1.jpg</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idhmoi0drp5">There was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted affection. There was a sense of justice in my father&apos;s upright mind which rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love strongly. Perhaps during former years he had suffered from the late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set a greater value on tried worth. There was a show of gratitude and worship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from the doting fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for her virtues and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing her for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace to his behaviour to her. Everything was made to yield to her wishes and her convenience. He strove to shelter her, as a fair exotic is sheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind and to surround her with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and benevolent mind. Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto constant spirit, had been shaken by what she had gone through. During the two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had gradually relinquished all his public functions; and immediately after their union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy, and the change of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders, as a restorative for her weakened frame.<span class="itali"> </span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idu9i8edytm"><span class="itali">People all say that I&#x2019;ve had a bad break. But today . . . today, I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idvlrcsv7b9">From Italy they visited Germany and France. I, their eldest child, was born at Naples, and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles. I remained for several years their only child. Much as they were attached to each other, they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very mine of love to bestow them upon me. My mother&apos;s tender caresses and my father&apos;s smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my first recollections. I was their plaything and their idol, and something better&#x2014;their child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on them by heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot it was in their hands to direct to happiness or misery, according as they fulfilled their duties towards me. With this deep consciousness of what they owed towards the being to which they had given life, added to the active spirit of tenderness that animated both, it may be imagined that while during every hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience, of charity, and of self-control, I was so guided by a silken cord that all seemed but one train of enjoyment to me.</p><p class="Ornamental-Space-BreakOsbrk" id="idfagowap31">***</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id601uxomfx">Here&#x2019;s a Victor Hugo poem:</p><div class="verse"><pre class="Verse1Vrs1" id="idwyuaoahal">Be like the bird who</pre><pre class="Verse1Vrs1" id="idtfriwzl21">Halting in his flight</pre><pre class="Verse1Vrs1" id="idp70cxq8tr">On limb too slight</pre><p class="SeparatorSep" id="idojqwxm7qo">Separator</p><pre class="Verse1Vrs1" id="iduu9gh7z8f">Feels it give way beneath him</pre><pre class="Verse1Vrs1" id="idg538920ed">Yet sings</pre><pre class="Verse1Vrs1" id="idm69dmsvjn">Knowing he hath wings</pre></div><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idci4y765zw">I am the bird and I will keep singing until I can&#x2019;t sing any longer&#x2014;and then I will sing some more.</p></section><div data-type="part" class=""><header><h1>Part I</h1></header><h1 class="NumberNum" id="id62gq969ck">Part I</h1><h1 class="TitleTtl" id="idq09onq5t2">Some Random Excerpts</h1><p class="Section-InterludeSIN" id="id71wkt63rv">Interlude</p><p class="Verse1Vrs1" id="idru0wxa0e0">How doth the little crocodile</p><p class="Verse1Vrs1" id="id82cqclfr9">Improve his shining tail,</p><p class="Verse1Vrs1" id="id076o6x989">And pour the waters of the Nile</p><p class="Verse1Vrs1" id="id8dxsgrbqs">On every golden scale!</p><p class="SeparatorSep" id="id3e0b03n3k">Separator</p><p class="Verse1Vrs1" id="idudz1iiqgo">How cheerfully he seems to grin,</p><p class="Verse1Vrs1" id="idpo895wloq">How neatly spread his claws,</p><p class="Verse1Vrs1" id="id1bajb3aul">And welcome little fishes in</p><p class="Verse1Vrs1" id="idaf2491ffk">With gently smiling jaws!</p><p class="SourceSrc" id="id15j52ag5o"><span class="itali">from</span> &#x201C;Alice&#x2019;s adventures in Wonderland,&#x201D; by Lewis Carroll</p><section data-type="chapter" id="sectidoybz11" class=""><header><h1>Chapter 1</h1></header><h1 class="TitleTtl" id="idqqd1xud5a" data-autolabel="yes" data-labeltext="Chapter 1">The Monster</h1><!--A Chapter Number paragraph directly preceding this Chapter Title paragraph was removed during conversion to HTML.

Elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated disposition; but, with all my ardour, I was capable of a more intense application and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge. <span class="boldb">span boldface characters (bf) </span><span class="itali">span italic characters (</span><span class="itali">ital</span><span class="itali">)</span><span class="bold-italbi"> </span><span class="smallcapssc">span small caps characters (</span><span class="smallcapssc">sc</span><span class="smallcapssc">)</span><span class="smallcaps-boldscb"> </span><span class="underlineu">span underscore characters (us)</span> <span class="supersup">span superscript characters (sup)</span> <span class="subsub">span subscript characters (sub)</span> <span class="bold-italbi">span bold </span><span class="bold-italbi">ital</span><span class="bold-italbi"> (</span><span class="bold-italbi">bem</span><span class="bold-italbi">) </span><span class="smallcaps-italsci">pan </span><span class="smallcaps-italsci">smcap</span><span class="smallcaps-italsci"> </span><span class="smallcaps-italsci">ital</span><span class="smallcaps-italsci"> (</span><span class="smallcaps-italsci">scital</span><span class="smallcaps-italsci">)</span><span class="boldb"> </span><span class="smallcaps-boldscb">span </span><span class="smallcaps-boldscb">smcap</span><span class="smallcaps-boldscb"> bold (</span><span class="smallcaps-boldscb">scbold</span><span class="smallcaps-boldscb">) </span><span class="symbolssym">span symbols (</span><span class="symbolssym">sym</span><span class="symbolssym">) span accent characters (acc) </span><span class="bookmaker-keep-togetherbkt">bookmaker </span><span class="bookmaker-keep-togetherbkt">keep</span><span class="bookmaker-keep-togetherbkt"> together (kt) </span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id3fjx0f95z">These next paragraphs test the &#x201C;computer type&#x201D; paragraph and character styles:</p><p class="Computer-TextComp" id="idjnxeqfqtf">Then you might want to stop texting and pay attention.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idourcn5tq3"><span class="cs-computerccom">You are so bossy</span>, I type.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idoe256d01d">She busied herself with following the aerial creations of the poets; and in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swiss home &#x2014;the sublime shapes of the mountains, the changes of the seasons, tempest and calm, the silence of winter, and the life and turbulence of our Alpine summers&#x2014;she found ample scope for admiration and delight. While my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the magnificent appearances of things, I delighted in investigating their causes. The world was to me a secret which I desired to divine. Curiosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature, gladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the earliest sensations I can remember.</p><p class="Ornamental-Space-BreakOsbrk" id="idi4yok3vn8">###</p><p class="Bookmaker-Processing-InstructionBpi" id="idl1ffssq55">IMAGE: wildcards.jpg global</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idrpmuzce3y">On the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gave up entirely their wandering life and fixed themselves in their native country. We possessed a house in Geneva, and a campagne on Belrive, the eastern shore of the lake, at the distance of rather more than a league from the city. We resided principally in the latter, and the lives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion. It was my temper to avoid a crowd and to attach myself fervently to a few. I was indifferent, therefore, to my school-fellows in general; but I united myself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them. Henry Clerval was the son of a merchant of Geneva. He was a boy of singular talent and fancy. He loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger for its own sake. He was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance. He composed heroic songs and began to write many a tale of enchantment and knightly adventure. He tried to make us act plays and to enter into masquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of Roncesvalles, of the Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous train who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands of the infidels.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ida0ccsi8nu">No human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself. My parents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence. We felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according to their caprice, but the agents and creators of all the many delights which we enjoyed. When I mingled with other families I distinctly discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted the development of filial love.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ide4m4vxx5i">My temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by some law in my temperature they were turned not towards childish pursuits but to an eager desire to learn, and not to learn all things indiscriminately. I confess that neither the structure of languages, nor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states possessed attractions for me. It was the secrets of heaven and earth that I desired to learn; and whether it was the outward substance of things or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man that occupied me, still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical, or in its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world.</p><p class="Ornamental-Space-BreakOsbrk" id="idozr1b0cic">###</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idhgasugujh">Meanwhile Clerval occupied himself, so to speak, with the moral relations of things. The busy stage of life, the virtues of heroes, and the actions of men were his theme; and his hope and his dream was to become one among those whose names are recorded in story as the gallant and adventurous benefactors of our species. The saintly soul of Elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our peaceful home. Her sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the sweet glance of her celestial eyes, were ever there to bless and animate us. She was the living spirit of love to soften and attract; I might have become sullen in my study, rough through the ardour of my nature, but that she was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness. And Clerval&#x2014;could aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of Clerval? Yet he might not have been so perfectly humane, so thoughtful in his generosity, so full of kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for adventurous exploit, had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of beneficence and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaring ambition.</p><blockquote data-type="recipe" class=""><p class="TitleTtl" id="idcaxqv562a">Small Batch Tiramisu from<span class="itali">Smitten</span><span class="itali"> Kitchen</span><span class="itali">:</span></p><p class="List-HeadLhead" id="idk9m7avd93"><span class="boldb">Ingredients:</span></p><ul class=""><li class="Unnum-Level-1-ListUl1"><p class="Unnum-Level-1-ListUl1" id="idkjp7sljms">24 ladyfingers (savioardi) cookies (storebought or from recipe below)</p></li><li class="Unnum-Level-1-ListUl1"><p class="Unnum-Level-1-ListUl1" id="ideqdetpygh">3 large eggs, separated</p></li><li class="Unnum-Level-1-ListUl1"><p class="Unnum-Level-1-ListUl1" id="idefz3zu5hr">1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon granulated sugar, divided</p></li><li class="Unnum-Level-1-ListUl1"><p class="Unnum-Level-1-ListUl1" id="idn1kj4v4i3">1 8.8-ounce (250 ml) package mascarpone</p></li><li class="Unnum-Level-1-ListUl1"><p class="Unnum-Level-1-ListUl1" id="idxuyh3p7rt">1/3 cup sweet or dry marsala</p></li><li class="Unnum-Level-1-ListUl1"><p class="Unnum-Level-1-ListUl1" id="id1iimn0ojt">1 cup strong, warm espresso coffee</p></li><li class="Unnum-Level-1-ListUl1"><p class="Unnum-Level-1-ListUl1" id="idal6skmba1">A couple tablespoons of your favorite cocoa powder, for sifting </p></li></ul><p class="List-HeadLhead" id="id8yb24ed3v"><span class="boldb">Directions:</span></p><ol class=""><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idauz5ms4in">1.

In this house I chanced to find a volume of the works of Cornelius Agrippa. I opened it with apathy; the theory which he attempts to demonstrate and the wonderful facts which he relates soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm. A new light seemed to dawn upon my mind, and bounding with joy, I communicated my discovery to my father. My father looked carelessly at the title page of my book and said, &quot;Ah! Cornelius Agrippa! My dear Victor, do not waste your time upon this; it is sad trash.&quot;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9aol4g2h4">Testing a centered paragraph on it&#x2019;s own.</p><p class="Bookmaker-Processing-InstructionBpi" id="idsfzbxkjjg">STYLES: center</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idu62j64rgs">If, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to me that the principles of Agrippa had been entirely exploded and that a modern system of science had been introduced which possessed much greater powers than the ancient, because the powers of the latter were chimerical, while those of the former were real and practical, under such circumstances I should certainly have thrown Agrippa aside and have contented my imagination, warmed as it was, by returning with greater ardour to my former studies. </p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id0wvatuthr">It is even possible that the train of my ideas would never have received the fatal impulse that led to my ruin.<span class="EndnoteReference"><span class="endnotereference" id="endnoteref_1">1</span></span></p><blockquote class="looseextract"><p class="Extract1Ext1" id="idzncqczrs7"><span class="smallcapssc">A Centered Extract</span></p></blockquote><p class="Bookmaker-Processing-InstructionBpi" id="idkv9jewoeg">STYLES: center</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idm8yysl9yx">But the cursory glance my father had taken of my volume by no means assured me that he was acquainted with its contents, and I continued to read with the greatest avidity. When I returned home my first care was to procure the whole works of this author, and afterwards of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus. I read and studied the wild fancies of these writers with delight; they appeared to me treasures known to few besides myself. I have described myself as always having been imbued with a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of nature. In spite of the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of modern philosophers, I always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied. Sir Isaac Newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picking up shells beside the great and unexplored ocean of truth. Those of his successors in each branch of natural philosophy with whom I was acquainted appeared even to my boy&apos;s apprehensions as tyros engaged in the same pursuit.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idnpw9p11af"><span class="itali">The untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was acquainted with their practical uses. The most learned philosopher knew little more. He had partially unveiled the face of Nature, but her immortal lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery. He might dissect, anatomize, and give names; but, not to speak of a final cause, causes in their secondary and tertiary grades were utterly unknown to him. I had gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to keep human beings from entering the citadel of nature, and rashly and ignorantly I had repined.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idubztkvrzn">But here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew more. I took their word for all that they averred, and I became their disciple. It may appear strange that such should arise in the eighteenth century; but while I followed the routine of education in the schools of Geneva, I was, to a great degree, self-taught with regard to my favourite studies. My father was not scientific, and I was left to struggle with a child&apos;s blindness, added to a student&apos;s thirst for knowledge. Under the guidance of my new preceptors I entered with the greatest diligence into the search of the philosopher&apos;s stone and the elixir of life; but the latter soon obtained my undivided attention. Wealth was an inferior object, but what glory would attend the discovery if I could banish disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death! Nor were these my only visions. The raising of ghosts or devils was a promise liberally accorded by my favourite authors, the fulfilment of which I most eagerly sought; and if my incantations were always unsuccessful, I attributed the failure rather to my own inexperience and mistake than to a want of skill or fidelity in my instructors. And thus for a time I was occupied by exploded systems, mingling, like an unadept, a thousand contradictory theories and floundering desperately in a very slough of multifarious knowledge, guided by an ardent imagination and childish reasoning, till an accident again changed the current of my ideas. When I was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house near Belrive, when we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunderstorm. It advanced from behind the mountains of Jura, and the thunder burst at once with frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens. I remained, while the storm lasted, watching its progress with curiosity and delight. As I stood at the door, on a sudden I beheld a stream of fire issue from an old and beautiful oak which stood about twenty yards from our house; and so soon as the dazzling light vanished, the oak had disappeared, and nothing remained but a blasted stump. When we visited it the next morning, we found the tree shattered in a singular manner. It was not splintered by the shock, but entirely reduced to thin ribbons of wood. I never beheld anything so utterly destroyed.</p><aside data-type="sidebar" class="table"><table><tr><td><p class="Table-HeadTbhd"><span class="boldb">CEO&#x2019;s DIWS Score</span></p></td><td><p class="Table-HeadTbhd"><span class="boldb">Annual Profit (in </span><span class="boldb">million</span><span class="CommentReference"/><span class="boldb"> $)</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="Table-TextTbtx"><span class="boldb">4</span></p></td><td><p class="Table-TextTbtx">6</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="Table-TextTbtx"><span class="boldb">5</span></p></td><td><p class="Table-TextTbtx">15</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="Table-TextTbtx"><span class="boldb">-6</span></p></td><td><p class="Table-TextTbtx">26</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="Table-TextTbtx"><span class="boldb">7</span></p></td><td><p class="Table-TextTbtx">39</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="Table-TextTbtx"><span class="boldb">3</span></p></td><td><p class="Table-TextTbtx">-1</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="Table-TextTbtx"><span class="boldb">12</span></p></td><td><p class="Table-TextTbtx">134</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="Table-TextTbtx"><span class="boldb">15</span></p></td><td><p class="Table-TextTbtx">215</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="Table-TextTbtx"><span class="boldb">22</span></p></td><td><p class="Table-TextTbtx">474</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="Table-TextTbtx"><span class="boldb">8</span></p></td><td><p class="Table-TextTbtx">54</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="Table-TextTbtx"><span class="boldb">6</span></p></td><td><p class="Table-TextTbtx">26</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="Table-TextTbtx"><span class="boldb">-8</span></p></td><td><p class="Table-TextTbtx">54</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="Table-TextTbtx"><span class="boldb">12</span></p></td><td><p class="Table-TextTbtx">134</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="Table-TextTbtx"><span class="boldb">18</span></p></td><td><p class="Table-TextTbtx">314</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="Table-TextTbtx"><span class="boldb">-3</span></p></td><td><p class="Table-TextTbtx">-1</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="Table-TextTbtx"><span class="boldb">-10</span></p></td><td><p class="Table-TextTbtx">90</p></td></tr></table></aside><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idccwev6hou">Before this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of electricity. On this occasion a man of great research in natural philosophy was with us, and excited by this catastrophe, he entered on the explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject of electricity and galvanism, which was at once new and astonishing to me. All that he said threw greatly into the shade Cornelius Agrippa, Albertus Magnus, and Paracelsus, the lords of my imagination; but by some fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my accustomed studies. It seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever be known. All that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew despicable. By one of those caprices of the mind which we are perhaps most subject to in early youth, I at once gave up my former occupations, set down natural history and all its progeny as a deformed and abortive creation, and entertained the greatest disdain for a would-be science which could never even step within the threshold of real knowledge.

I had hitherto attended the schools of Geneva, but my father thought it necessary for the completion of my education that I should be made acquainted with other customs than those of my native country. My departure was therefore fixed at an early date, but before the day resolved upon could arrive, the first misfortune of my life occurred&#x2014;an omen, as it were, of my future misery. Elizabeth had caught the scarlet fever; her illness was severe, and she was in the greatest danger. During her illness many arguments had been urged to persuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her. She had at first yielded to our entreaties, but when she heard that the life of her favourite was menaced, she could no longer control her anxiety. She attended her sickbed; her watchful attentions triumphed over the malignity of the distemper&#x2014;Elizabeth was saved, but the consequences of this imprudence were fatal to her preserver. On the third day my mother sickened; her fever was accompanied by the most alarming symptoms, and the looks of her medical attendants prognosticated the worst event. On her deathbed the fortitude and benignity of this best of women did not desert her. She joined the hands of Elizabeth and myself. &quot;My children,&quot; she said, &quot;my firmest hopes of future happiness were placed on the prospect of your union. This expectation will now be the consolation of your father. Elizabeth, my love, you must supply my place to my younger children. Alas! I regret that I am taken from you; and, happy and beloved as I have been, is it not hard to quit you all? But these are not thoughts befitting me; I will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to death and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world.&quot;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idxwbngwxci">She died calmly, and her countenance expressed affection even in death. I need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent by that most irreparable evil, the void that presents itself to the soul, and the despair that is exhibited on the countenance. It is so long before the mind can persuade itself that she whom we saw every day and whose very existence appeared a part of our own can have departed forever&#x2014;that the brightness of a beloved eye can have been extinguished and the sound of a voice so familiar and dear to the ear can be hushed, never more to be heard. These are the reflections of the first days; but when the lapse of time proves the reality of the evil, then the actual bitterness of grief commences. Yet from whom has not that rude hand rent away some dear connection? And why should I describe a sorrow which all have felt, and must feel? The time at length arrives when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity; and the smile that plays upon the lips, although it may be deemed a sacrilege, is not banished. My mother was dead, but we had still duties which we ought to perform; we must continue our course with the rest and learn to think ourselves fortunate whilst one remains whom the spoiler has not seized.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idonct4cqob">My departure for Ingolstadt, which had been deferred by these events, was now again determined upon. I obtained from my father a respite of some weeks. It appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose, akin to death, of the house of mourning and to rush into the thick of life. I was new to sorrow, but it did not the less alarm me. I was unwilling to quit the sight of those that remained to me, and above all, I desired to see my sweet Elizabeth in some degree consoled.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idcs789oben">She indeed veiled her grief and strove to act the comforter to us all. She looked steadily on life and assumed its duties with courage and zeal. She devoted herself to those whom she had been taught to call her uncle and cousins. Never was she so enchanting as at this time, when she recalled the sunshine of her smiles and spent them upon us. She forgot even her own regret in her endeavours to make us forget.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id70pfoxysh">The day of my departure at length arrived. Clerval spent the last evening with us. He had endeavoured to persuade his father to permit him to accompany me and to become my fellow student, but in vain. His father was a narrow-minded trader and saw idleness and ruin in the aspirations and ambition of his son. Henry deeply felt the misfortune of being debarred from a liberal education. He said little, but when he spoke I read in his kindling eye and in his animated glance a restrained but firm resolve not to be chained to the miserable details of commerce.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2dxa998uu">We sat late. We could not tear ourselves away from each other nor persuade ourselves to say the word &quot;Farewell!&quot; It was said, and we retired under the pretence of seeking repose, each fancying that the other was deceived; but when at morning&apos;s dawn I descended to the carriage which was to convey me away, they were all there&#x2014;my father again to bless me, Clerval to press my hand once more, my Elizabeth to renew her entreaties that I would write often and to bestow the last feminine attentions on her playmate and friend.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idj8j36sg6a">I threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away and indulged in the most melancholy reflections. I, who had ever been surrounded by amiable companions, continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual pleasure&#x2014;I was now alone. In the university whither I was going I must form my own friends and be my own protector. My life had hitherto been remarkably secluded and domestic, and this had given me invincible repugnance to new countenances. I loved my brothers, Elizabeth, and Clerval; these were &quot;old familiar faces,&quot; but I believed myself totally unfitted for the company of strangers. Such were my reflections as I commenced my journey; but as I proceeded, my spirits and hopes rose. I ardently desired the acquisition of knowledge. I had often, when at home, thought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place and had longed to enter the world and take my station among other human beings. Now my desires were complied with, and it would, indeed, have been folly to repent.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idyzvp3qhht"/><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddgihfpbzu">I had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my journey to Ingolstadt, which was long and fatiguing. At length the high white steeple of the town met my eyes. I alighted and was conducted to my solitary apartment to spend the evening as I pleased.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idg8iv7bfu4">The next morning I delivered my letters of introduction and paid a visit to some of the principal professors. Chance&#x2014;or rather the evil influence, the Angel of Destruction, which asserted omnipotent sway over me from the moment I turned my reluctant steps from my father&apos;s door&#x2014;led me first to M. Krempe, professor of natural philosophy. He was an uncouth man, but deeply imbued in the secrets of his science. He asked me several questions concerning my progress in the different branches of science appertaining to natural philosophy. I replied carelessly, and partly in contempt, mentioned the names of my alchemists as the principal authors I had studied. The professor stared. &quot;Have you,&quot; he said, &quot;really spent your time in studying such nonsense?&quot;</p><p class="HeadlineHdline" id="idvl57k043x">&#x201C;BE STILL.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idzghwzb15i">I replied in the affirmative. &quot;Every minute,&quot; continued M. Krempe with warmth, &quot;every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly and entirely lost. You have burdened your memory with exploded systems and useless names. Good God! In what desert land have you lived, where no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies which you have so greedily <span class="boldb">imbibed</span> are a thousand years old and as musty as they are ancient? I little expected, in this enlightened and scientific age, to find a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus. My dear sir, you must begin your studies entirely anew.&quot;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idkcajj5owd">So saying, he stepped aside and wrote down a list of several books treating of natural philosophy which he desired me to procure, and dismissed me after mentioning that in the beginning of the following week he intended to commence a course of lectures upon natural philosophy in its general relations, and that M. Waldman, a fellow professor, would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that he omitted.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idppctzt6pk">I returned home not disappointed, for I have said that I had long considered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated; but I returned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any shape. M. Krempe was a little squat man with a gruff voice and a repulsive countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me in favour of his pursuits. In rather a too philosophical and connected a strain, perhaps, I have given an account of the conclusions I had come to concerning them in my early years. As a child I had not been content with the results promised by the modern professors of natural science. With a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my extreme youth and my want of a guide on such matters, I had retrod the steps of knowledge along the paths of time and exchanged the discoveries of recent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchemists. Besides, I had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy. It was very different when the masters of the science sought immortality and power; such views, although futile, were grand; but now the scene was changed. The ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in science was chiefly founded. I was required to exchange chimeras of boundless grandeur for realities of little worth.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idt0o3ganfn">Such were my reflections during the first two or three days of my residence at Ingolstadt, which were chiefly spent in becoming acquainted with the localities and the principal residents in my new abode. But as the ensuing week commenced, I thought of the information which M. Krempe had given me concerning the lectures. And although I could not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver sentences out of a pulpit, I recollected what he had said of M. Waldman, whom I had never seen, as he had hitherto been out of town.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idoeuiy01p7">Partly from curiosity and partly from idleness, I went into the lecturing room, which M. Waldman entered shortly after. This professor was very unlike his colleague. He appeared about fifty years of age, but with an aspect expressive of the greatest benevolence; a few grey hairs covered his temples, but those at the back of his head were nearly black. His person was short but remarkably erect and his voice the sweetest I had ever heard. He began his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry and the various improvements made by different men of learning, pronouncing with fervour the names of the most distinguished discoverers. He then took a cursory view of the present state of the science and explained many of its elementary terms. After having made a few preparatory experiments, he concluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry, the terms of which I shall never forget: &quot;The ancient teachers of this science,&quot; said he, &quot;promised impossibilities and performed nothing. The modern masters promise very little; they know that metals cannot be transmuted and that the elixir of life is a chimera but these philosophers, whose hands seem only made to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to pore over the microscope or crucible, have indeed performed miracles. They penetrate into the recesses of nature and show how she works in her hiding-places. They ascend into the heavens; they have discovered how the blood circulates, and the nature of the air we breathe. They have acquired new and almost unlimited powers; they can command the thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.&quot;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2o8f3liib">Such were the professor&apos;s words&#x2014;rather let me say such the words of the fate&#x2014;enounced to destroy me. As he went on I felt as if my soul were grappling with a palpable enemy; one by one the various keys were touched which formed the mechanism of my being; chord after chord was sounded, and soon my mind was filled with one thought, one conception, one purpose. So much has been done, exclaimed the soul of Frankenstein&#x2014;more, far more, will I achieve; treading in the steps already marked, I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idlr9g24dkm">I closed not my eyes that night. My internal being was in a state of insurrection and turmoil; I felt that order would thence arise, but I had no power to produce it. By degrees, after the morning&apos;s dawn, sleep came. I awoke, and my yesternight&apos;s thoughts were as a dream. There only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies and to devote myself to a science for which I believed myself to possess a natural talent. On the same day I paid M. Waldman a visit. His manners in private were even more mild and attractive than in public, for there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture which in his own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness. I gave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as I had given to his fellow professor. He heard with attention the little narration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of Cornelius Agrippa and Paracelsus, but without the contempt that M. Krempe had exhibited. He said that &quot;These were men to whose indefatigable zeal modern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their knowledge. They had left to us, as an easier task, to give new names and arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light. The labours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind.&quot; I listened to his statement, which was delivered without any presumption or affectation, and then added that his lecture had removed my prejudices against modern chemists; I expressed myself in measured terms, with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his instructor, without letting escape (inexperience in life would have made me ashamed) any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended labours. I requested his advice concerning the books I ought to procure.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idp035lf944">&quot;I am happy,&quot; said M. Waldman, &quot;to have gained a disciple; and if your application equals your ability, I have no doubt of your success. Chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which the greatest improvements have been and may be made; it is on that account that I have made it my peculiar study; but at the same time, I have not neglected the other branches of science. A man would make but a very sorry chemist if he attended to that department of human knowledge alone. If your wish is to become really a man of science and not merely a petty experimentalist, I should advise you to apply to every branch of natural philosophy, including mathematics.&quot; He then took me into his laboratory and explained to me the uses of his various machines, instructing me as to what I ought to procure and promising me the use of his own when I should have advanced far enough in the science not to derange their mechanism. He also gave me the list of books which I had requested, and I took my leave.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddufk0ekse">From this day natural philosophy, and particularly chemistry, in the most comprehensive sense of the term, became nearly my sole occupation. I read with ardour those works, so full of genius and discrimination, which modern inquirers have written on these subjects. I attended the lectures and cultivated the acquaintance of the men of science of the university, and I found even in M. Krempe a great deal of sound sense and real information, combined, it is true, with a repulsive physiognomy and manners, but not on that account the less valuable. In M. Waldman I found a true friend. His gentleness was never tinged by dogmatism, and his instructions were given with an air of frankness and good nature that banished every idea of pedantry. In a thousand ways he smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruse inquiries clear and facile to my apprehension.

As I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that my progress was rapid. My ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students, and my proficiency that of the masters. Professor Krempe often asked me, with a sly smile, how Cornelius Agrippa went on, whilst M. Waldman expressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress. Two years passed in this manner, during which I paid no visit to Geneva, but was engaged, heart and soul, in the pursuit of some discoveries which I hoped to make.</p><blockquote data-type="letter" class=""><p class="AddressAdd" id="id8ju68j3x0">175 Fifth Ave.</p><p class="AddressAdd" id="idz8k6opby6">New York, NY 10010</p><p class="DatelineDate" id="idmj8zswis6">January 21, 2017</p><p class="HeadnoteHdnt" id="idibsduypah">This letter is confidential.</p><p class="SalutationSal" id="idg7lvrczkw">Dear Sir,</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idqd173bkha">Please accept this submission for publication.

Welcome to the big league.</p></blockquote><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idhpaubjwht">One of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was the structure of the human frame, and, indeed, any animal endued with life. Whence, I often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed? It was a bold question, and one which has ever been considered as a mystery; yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming acquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our inquiries. I revolved these circumstances in my mind and determined thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of natural philosophy which relate to physiology. Unless I had been animated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm, my application to this study would have been irksome and almost intolerable. </p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idckbju8yw6">To examine the causes of life, we must first have recourse to death. I became acquainted with the science of anatomy, but this was not sufficient; I must also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body. </p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idp0mcsb8pn">In my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my mind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors. I do not ever remember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared the apparition of a spirit. Darkness had no effect upon my fancy, and a churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of life, which, from being the seat of beauty and strength, had become food for the worm. Now I was led to examine the cause and progress of this decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and charnel-houses. My attention was fixed upon every object the most insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings. . . .<span class="EndnoteReference"><span class="endnotereference" id="endnoteref_2">2</span></span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idrjxqmqeog">I saw how the fine form of man was degraded and wasted; I beheld the corruption of death succeed to the blooming cheek of life; I saw how the worm inherited the wonders of the eye and brain. I paused, examining and analysing all the minutiae of causation, as exemplified in the change from life to death, and death to life, until from the midst of this darkness a sudden light broke in upon me&#x2014;a light so brilliant and wondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the immensity of the prospect which it illustrated, I was surprised that among so many men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the same science, that I alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a secret.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idrvu10nxzy">Remember, I am not recording the vision of a madman. The sun does not more certainly shine in the heavens than that which I now affirm is true. Some miracle might have produced it, yet the stages of the discovery were distinct and probable. After days and nights of incredible labour and fatigue, I succeeded in discovering the cause of generation and life; nay, more, I became myself capable of bestowing animation upon lifeless matter.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idxvai7nf0n">The astonishment which I had at first experienced on this discovery soon gave place to delight and rapture. After so much time spent in painful labour, to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was the most gratifying consummation of my toils. But this discovery was so great and overwhelming that all the steps by which I had been progressively led to it were obliterated, and I beheld only the result. What had been the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation of the world was now within my grasp. Not that, like a magic scene, it all opened upon me at once: the information I had obtained was of a nature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as I should point them towards the object of my search than to exhibit that object already accomplished. I was like the Arabian who had been buried with the dead and found a passage to life, aided only by one glimmering and seemingly ineffectual light.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idh6669gtd7">I see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes express, my friend, that you expect to be informed of the secret with which I am acquainted; that cannot be; listen patiently until the end of my story, and you will easily perceive why I am reserved upon that subject. I will not lead you on, unguarded and ardent as I then was, to your destruction and infallible misery. Learn from me, if not by my precepts, at least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge and how much happier that man is who believes his native town to be the world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature will allow.</p><aside data-type="sidebar" class=""><p class="TitleTtl" id="idsx8i4ari2">Mapping out the unknown</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idnvcjuholr">Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, &#x2018;Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it&#x2019;s getting!&#x2019; </p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idojadag6l1">She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idpfxx6xwz3">There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idksccl5qe9">All right! With these caveats in mind, let&apos;s go over several scenarios that are worth looking at.</p><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="idznm62r921">Problem space #1: Falling Down a Hole</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idyylofdyaq">Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice&#x2019;s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddh1uqwf5d">However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted:</p><ul class=""><li class="Bullet-Level-1-ListBl1"><p class="Bullet-Level-1-ListBl1" id="id73i62mceg">Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway; &#x2018;and even if my head would go through,&#x2019; thought poor Alice, &#x2018;it would be of very little use without my shoulders.</p></li><li class="Bullet-Level-1-ListBl1"><p class="Bullet-Level-1-ListBl1" id="idgzz7uaxse">Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.&#x2019; For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.</p></li></ul><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddagrkun6g">When I found so astonishing a power placed within my hands, I hesitated a long time concerning the manner in which I should employ it. Although I possessed the capacity of bestowing animation, yet to prepare a frame for the reception of it, with all its intricacies of fibres, muscles, and veins, still remained a work of inconceivable difficulty and labour. </p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id0tqmrvamo">I doubted at first whether I should attempt the creation of a being like myself, or one of simpler organization; but my imagination was too much exalted by my first success to permit me to doubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and wonderful as man. The materials at present within my command hardly appeared adequate to so arduous an undertaking, but I doubted not that I should ultimately succeed. </p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idkpd8yclvd">I prepared myself for a multitude of reverses; my operations might be incessantly baffled, and at last my work be imperfect, yet when I considered the improvement which every day takes place in science and mechanics, I was encouraged to hope my present attempts would at least lay the foundations of future success. Nor could I consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any argument of its impracticability. It was with these feelings that I began the creation of a human being. As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my first intention, to make the being of a gigantic stature, that is to say, about eight feet in height, and proportionably large. After having formed this determination and having spent some months in successfully collecting and arranging my materials, I began.</p><div class="computer"><pre class="TitleTtl" id="id8m0roh4ga">Formerly, A Poem</pre><pre class="Verse1Vrs1" id="id55f1bagd6">Tiger tiger burning bright</pre><pre class="Verse1Vrs1" id="idndgyy6tor">In the forests of the night</pre></div><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id5nr9k1xbd">No one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like a hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success. Life and death appeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and pour a torrent of light into our dark world. A new species would bless me as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would owe their being to me. No father could claim the gratitude of his child so completely as I should deserve theirs. Pursuing these reflections, I thought that if I could bestow animation upon lifeless matter, I might in process of time (although I now found it impossible) renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idpjltjyouq">These thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my undertaking with unremitting ardour. My cheek had grown pale with study, and my person had become emaciated with confinement. Sometimes, on the very brink of certainty, I failed; yet still I clung to the hope which the next day or the next hour might realize. One secret which I alone possessed was the hope to which I had dedicated myself; and the moon gazed on my midnight labours, while, with unrelaxed and breathless eagerness, I pursued nature to her hiding-places. </p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idnu9m0zabf">Who shall conceive the horrors of my secret toil as I dabbled among the unhallowed damps of the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless clay? My limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with the remembrance; but then a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward; I seemed to have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit. It was indeed but a passing trance, that only made me feel with renewed acuteness so soon as, the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, I had returned to my old habits. </p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id0n6xkbzvu">I collected bones from charnel-houses and disturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human frame. In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house, and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase, I kept my workshop of filthy creation; my eyeballs were starting from their sockets in attending to the details of my employment. The dissecting room and the slaughter-house furnished many of my materials; and often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation, whilst, still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased, I brought my work near to a conclusion.</p><p class="Blank-Space-BreakBsbrk" id="id9hlbap0y1">[blank]</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idap1yydczv">The summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and soul, in one pursuit. It was a most beautiful season; never did the fields bestow a more plentiful harvest or the vines yield a more luxuriant vintage, but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature. And the same feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also to forget those friends who were so many miles absent, and whom I had not seen for so long a time. I knew my silence disquieted them, and I well remembered the words of my father: &quot;I know that while you are pleased with yourself you will think of us with affection, and we shall hear regularly from you. You must pardon me if I regard any interruption in your correspondence as a proof that your other duties are equally neglected.&quot;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id8fg2ph7gq">I knew well therefore what would be my father&apos;s feelings, but I could not tear my thoughts from my employment, loathsome in itself, but which had taken an irresistible hold of my imagination. I wished, as it were, to procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection until the great object, which swallowed up every habit of my nature, should be completed.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ida28xu6gqf">I then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect to vice or faultiness on my part, but I am now convinced that he was justified in conceiving that I should not be altogether free from blame. A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and peaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to disturb his tranquillity. I do not think that the pursuit of knowledge is an exception to this rule. If the study to which you apply yourself has a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that study is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human mind. If this rule were always observed; if no man allowed any pursuit whatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic affections, Greece had not been enslaved, Caesar would have spared his country, America would have been discovered more gradually, and the empires of Mexico and Peru had not been destroyed.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1fu8rwuvh">But I forget that I am moralizing in the most interesting part of my tale, and your looks remind me to proceed. My father made no reproach in his letters and only took notice of my silence by inquiring into my occupations more particularly than before. Winter, spring, and summer passed away during my labours; but I did not watch the blossom or the expanding leaves&#x2014;sights which before always yielded me supreme delight&#x2014;so deeply was I engrossed in my occupation. The leaves of that year had withered before my work drew near to a close, and now every day showed me more plainly how well I had succeeded. But my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety, and I appeared rather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines, or any other unwholesome trade than an artist occupied by his favourite employment. Every night I was oppressed by a slow fever, and I became nervous to a most painful degree; the fall of a leaf startled me, and I shunned my fellow creatures as if I had been guilty of a crime. Sometimes I grew alarmed at the wreck I perceived that I had become; the energy of my purpose alone sustained me: my labours would soon end, and I believed that exercise and amusement would then drive away incipient disease; and I promised myself both of these when my creation should be complete.</p><p class="Blank-Space-BreakBsbrk" id="idfilp0c5u7">[blank]</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idhlahbqtn2">It was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the accomplishment of my toils. With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I collected the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet. It was already one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against the panes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id5oqbn0dwj">How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to form? His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as beautiful. Beautiful! Great God! His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which they were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id14gmd7r9b">The different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings of human nature. I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body. For this I had deprived myself of rest and health. I had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation; but now that I had finished, the beauty of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart. Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created, I rushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my bed-chamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep. At length lassitude succeeded to the tumult I had before endured, and I threw myself on the bed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness. But it was in vain; I slept, indeed, but I was disturbed by the wildest dreams. I thought I saw Elizabeth, in the bloom of health, walking in the streets of Ingolstadt. Delighted and surprised, I embraced her, but as I imprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with the hue of death; her features appeared to change, and I thought that I held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped her form, and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel. I started from my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, my teeth chattered, and every limb became convulsed; when, by the dim and yellow light of the moon, as it forced its way through the window shutters, I beheld the wretch&#x2014;the miserable monster whom I had created. He held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes they may be called, were fixed on me. His jaws opened, and he muttered some inarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks. He might have spoken, but I did not hear; one hand was stretched out, seemingly to detain me, but I escaped and rushed downstairs. I took refuge in the courtyard belonging to the house which I inhabited, where I remained during the rest of the night, walking up and down in the greatest agitation, listening attentively, catching and fearing each sound as if it were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which I had so miserably given life.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idc2is1qw16"><span class="itali">Oh! No mortal could support the horror of that countenance. A mummy again endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch. I had gazed on him while unfinished; he was ugly then, but when those muscles and joints were rendered capable of motion, it became a thing such as even Dante could not have conceived.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idiry7pav88"><span class="itali">I passed the night wretchedly. Sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and hardly that I felt the palpitation of every artery; at others, I nearly sank to the ground through languor and extreme weakness. Mingled with this horror, I felt the bitterness of disappointment; dreams that had been my food and pleasant rest for so long a space were now become a hell to me; and the change was so rapid, the overthrow so complete!</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idb76mpwh8n">Morning, dismal and wet, at length dawned and discovered to my sleepless and aching eyes the church of Ingolstadt, its white steeple and clock, which indicated the sixth hour. The porter opened the gates of the court, which had that night been my asylum, and I issued into the streets, pacing them with quick steps, as if I sought to avoid the wretch whom I feared every turning of the street would present to my view. I did not dare return to the apartment which I inhabited, but felt impelled to hurry on, although drenched by the rain which poured from a black and comfortless sky. </p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idhi8t4uqca">I continued walking in this manner for some time,<span class="" id="footnote_3" data-type="footnote"><span class="FootnoteText"><span class="FootnoteReference"/> It was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the accomplishment of my toils.

I traversed the streets without any clear conception of where I was or what I was doing. My heart palpitated in the sickness of fear, and I hurried on with irregular steps, not daring to look about me.</p><p class="Blank-Space-BreakBsbrk" id="idvr1nyszkm">[blank]</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9x8zdggaz">Continuing thus, I came at length opposite to the inn at which the various diligences and carriages usually stopped. Here I paused, I knew not why; but I remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that was coming towards me from the other end of the street. As it drew nearer I observed that it was the Swiss diligence; it stopped just where I was standing, and on the door being opened, I perceived Henry Clerval, who, on seeing me, instantly sprung out. &quot;My dear Frankenstein,&quot; exclaimed he, &quot;how glad I am to see you! How fortunate that you should be here at the very moment of my alighting!&quot;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idzs0pgej8y">Nothing could equal my delight on seeing Clerval; his presence brought back to my thoughts my father, Elizabeth, and all those scenes of home so dear to my recollection. I grasped his hand, and in a moment forgot my horror and misfortune; I felt suddenly, and for the first time during many months, calm and serene joy. I welcomed my friend, therefore, in the most cordial manner, and we walked towards my college. Clerval continued talking for some time about our mutual friends and his own good fortune in being permitted to come to Ingolstadt. &quot;You may easily believe,&quot; said he, &quot;how great was the difficulty to persuade my father that all necessary knowledge was not comprised in the noble art of book-keeping; and, indeed, I believe I left him incredulous to the last, for his constant answer to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the Dutch schoolmaster in The Vicar of <span class="smallcapssc">WAKEfield</span>: &apos;I have ten thousand florins a year without Greek, I eat heartily without Greek.&apos; But his affection for me at length overcame his dislike of learning, and he has permitted me to undertake a voyage of discovery to the land of knowledge.&quot;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddi4l1zhmt">&quot;It gives me the greatest delight to see you; but tell me how you left my father, brothers, and Elizabeth.&quot;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9vb1z82sa">&quot;Very well, and very happy, only a little uneasy that they hear from you so seldom. By the by, I mean to lecture you a little upon their account myself. But, my dear Frankenstein,&quot; continued he, stopping short and gazing full in my face, &quot;I did not before remark how very ill you appear; so thin and pale; you look as if you had been watching for several nights.&quot;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idxi7rrj2fc">&quot;You have guessed right; I have lately been so deeply engaged in one occupation that I have not allowed myself sufficient rest, as you see; but I hope, I sincerely hope, that all these employments are now at an end and that I am at length free.&quot;</p><p class="Blank-Space-BreakBsbrk" id="iddauyf5b77">[blank]</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idp8kckna7x">I trembled excessively.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idmgv3ecj4d">I could not endure to think of, and far less to allude to, the occurrences of the preceding night. I walked with a quick pace, and we soon arrived at my college. I then reflected, and the thought made me shiver, that the creature whom I had left in my apartment might still be there, alive and walking about. I dreaded to behold this monster, but I feared still more that Henry should see him. Entreating him, therefore, to remain a few minutes at the bottom of the stairs, I darted up towards my own room. My hand was already on the lock of the door before I recollected myself. I then paused, and a cold shivering came over me. I threw the door forcibly open, as children are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in waiting for them on the other side; but nothing appeared. I stepped fearfully in: the apartment was empty, and my bedroom was also freed from its hideous guest. I could hardly believe that so great a good fortune could have befallen me, but when I became assured that my enemy had indeed fled, I clapped my hands for joy and ran down to Clerval.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idl958qz1rt">We ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought breakfast; but I was unable to contain myself. It was not joy only that possessed me; I felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness, and my pulse beat rapidly. I was unable to remain for a single instant in the same place; I jumped over the chairs, clapped my hands, and laughed aloud. Clerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival, but when he observed me more attentively, he saw a wildness in my eyes for which he could not account, and my loud, unrestrained, heartless laughter frightened and astonished him.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idfyg46rh34">&quot;My dear Victor,&quot; cried he, &quot;what, for God&apos;s sake, is the matter? Do not laugh in that manner. How ill you are! What is the cause of all this?&quot;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idkbd2zpl81">&quot;Do not ask me,&quot; cried I, putting my hands before my eyes, for I thought I saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room; &quot;HE can tell. Oh, save me! Save me!&quot; I imagined that the monster seized me; I struggled furiously and fell down in a fit.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idh3bzde1ap">Poor Clerval! What must have been his feelings? A meeting, which he anticipated with such joy, so strangely turned to bitterness. But I was not the witness of his grief, for I was lifeless and did not recover my senses for a long, long time.</p><p class="Blank-Space-BreakBsbrk" id="id6sl39r28n">[blank]</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idm19hylfsv">This was the commencement of a nervous fever which confined me for several months. During all that time Henry was my only nurse. I afterwards learned that, knowing my father&apos;s advanced age and unfitness for so long a journey, and how wretched my sickness would make Elizabeth, he spared them this grief by concealing the extent of my disorder. He knew that I could not have a more kind and attentive nurse than himself; and, firm in the hope he felt of my recovery, he did not doubt that, instead of doing harm, he performed the kindest action that he could towards them.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2ss2n6xce">But I was in reality very ill, and surely nothing but the unbounded and unremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life. The form of the monster on whom I had bestowed existence was forever before my eyes, and I raved incessantly concerning him. Doubtless my words surprised Henry; he at first believed them to be the wanderings of my disturbed imagination, but the pertinacity with which I continually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorder indeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idtg4ua4ulq">By very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses that alarmed and grieved my friend, I recovered. I remember the first time I became capable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure, I perceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared and that the young buds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window. It was a divine spring, and the season contributed greatly to my convalescence. I felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in my bosom; my gloom disappeared, and in a short time I became as cheerful as before I was attacked by the fatal passion.</p></aside><figure class="Image-PlacementImg" id="idz7s2qqwwm"><img src="images/dragons-fantasy_fullpage.jpg" alt="This%20is%20a%20caption%20above%20an%20image."/><figcaption class="CaptionCap" id="idciwb9pria">This is a caption above an image.</figcaption><p class="Credit-LineCrd" id="idobollixfb"><a class="fig-link">Image courtesy of some great wizard</a></p></figure><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idp701p71v5">&quot;Dearest Clerval,&quot; exclaimed I, &quot;how kind, how very good you are to me.

In doing this, I underwent a kind of rough usage, ill befitting the wounds that my mind had sustained. Ever since the fatal night, the end of my labours, and the beginning of my misfortunes, I had conceived a violent antipathy even to the name of natural philosophy. When I was otherwise quite restored to health, the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony of my nervous symptoms. Henry saw this, and had removed all my apparatus from my view.

M. Waldman inflicted torture when he praised, with kindness and warmth, the astonishing progress I had made in the sciences. He soon perceived that I disliked the subject; but not guessing the real cause, he attributed my feelings to modesty, and changed the subject from my improvement, to the science itself, with a desire, as I evidently saw, of drawing me out. What could I do? He meant to please, and he tormented me. I felt as if he had placed carefully, one by one, in my view those instruments which were to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death. I writhed under his words, yet dared not exhibit the pain I felt. </p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9v6y7nat9">Clerval, whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the sensations of others, declined the subject, alleging, in excuse, his total ignorance; and the conversation took a more general turn.

I saw plainly that he was surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret from me; and although I loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence that knew no bounds, yet I could never persuade myself to confide in him that event which was so often present to my recollection, but which I feared the detail to another would only impress more deeply.</p><figure class="Image-PlacementImg" id="idc4gooc6xi"><img src="images/Noimagefile.jpg" alt="This%20is%20an%20image%20that%20is%20missing."/><figcaption class="CaptionCap" id="idq1hzg5kva">This is an image that is missing.</figcaption></figure><figure class="Image-PlacementImg" id="idkzk7pbekr"><img src="images/TestAI.ai" alt="This%20is%20an%20unsupported%20image%20type%20that%20should%20get%20converted."/><figcaption class="CaptionCap" id="idgahltdb4d">This is an unsupported image type that should get converted.</figcaption></figure></ol></section></div><div data-type="part" class=""><header><h1>Part 2</h1></header><h1 class="NumberNum" id="id5x11mmxr5">Part 2</h1><h1 class="TitleTtl" id="idupgmcx9n1">This Guy Thinks He Knows A Lot</h1><section data-type="chapter" id="sectidyvod13" class=""><header><h1>Chapter 3a</h1></header><h1 class="TitleTtl" id="idrzz83g940">A Letter From My Father</h1><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idpjg1kqirs">On my return, I found the following letter from my father:&#x2014;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ide5hi0iqyo">&quot;My dear Victor,</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idac75za3om">&quot;You have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of your return to us; and I was at first tempted to write only a few lines, merely mentioning the day on which I should expect you.

The evening was warm and serene, and we prolonged our walk farther than usual. It was already dusk before we thought of returning; and then we discovered that William and Ernest, who had gone on before, were not to be found. We accordingly rested on a seat until they should return. Presently Ernest came, and enquired if we had seen his brother; he said, that he had been playing with him, that William had run away to hide himself, and that he vainly sought for him, and afterwards waited for a long time, but that he did not return. This account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for him until night fell, when Elizabeth conjectured that he might have returned to the house. He was not there. We returned again, with torches; for I could not rest, when I thought that my sweet boy had lost himself, and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night; Elizabeth also suffered extreme anguish. About five in the morning I discovered my lovely boy, whom the night before I had seen blooming and active in health, stretched on the grass livid and motionless; the print of the murder&apos;s finger was on his neck.</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idawmiyi9u5"><span class="boldb">He was conveyed home</span></p><p class="Num-Level-1-List-ParagraphNl1p" id="id0li1rbrjy">The anguish that was visible in my countenance betrayed the secret to Elizabeth. She was very earnest to see the corpse. At first I attempted to prevent her but she persisted, and entering the room where it lay, hastily examined the neck of the victim, and clasping her hands exclaimed, &apos;O God! I have murdered my darling child!&apos; &quot;She fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty. When she again lived, it was only to weep and sigh. She told me, that that same evening William had teased her to let him wear a very valuable miniature that she possessed of your mother. This picture is gone, and was doubtless the temptation which urged the murderer to the deed. We have no trace of him at present, although our exertions to discover him are unremitted; but they will not restore my beloved William!</p></li></ol><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ido9tgxgs9m">&quot;Come, dearest Victor; you alone can console Elizabeth. She weeps continually, and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death; her words pierce my heart.

What do you intend to do?&quot;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idfricejxps">&quot;To go instantly to Geneva: come with me, Henry, to order the horses.&quot;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idz889ozzxv">During our walk, Clerval endeavoured to say a few words of consolation; he could only express his heartfelt sympathy. &quot;Poor William!&quot; said he, &quot;dear lovely child, he now sleeps with his angel mother! Who that had seen him bright and joyous in his young beauty, but must weep over his untimely loss! To die so miserably; to feel the murderer&apos;s grasp! How much more a murdered that could destroy radiant innocence! Poor little fellow! one only consolation have we; his friends mourn and weep, but he is at rest. The pang is over, his sufferings are at an end for ever. A sod covers his gentle form, and he knows no pain. He can no longer be a subject for pity; we must reserve that for his miserable survivors.&quot;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id34mmq3vm4">Clerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets; the words impressed themselves on my mind and I remembered them afterwards in solitude. But now, as soon as the horses arrived, I hurried into a cabriolet, and bade farewell to my friend.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ide2y6344hf">My journey was very melancholy. At first I wished to hurry on, for I longed to console and sympathise with my loved and sorrowing friends; but when I drew near my native town, I slackened my progress. I could hardly sustain the multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind. I passed through scenes familiar to my youth, but which I had not seen for nearly six years. How altered every thing might be during that time! One sudden and desolating change had taken place; but a thousand little circumstances might have by degrees worked other alterations, which, although they were done more tranquilly, might not be the less decisive. Fear overcame me; I dared no advance, dreading a thousand nameless evils that made me tremble, although I was unable to define them. I remained two days at Lausanne, in this painful state of mind. I contemplated the lake: the waters were placid; all around was calm; and the snowy mountains, &apos;the palaces of nature,&apos; were not changed. By degrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me, and I continued my journey towards Geneva.&lt;NoteCallout&gt;1&lt;/NoteCallout&gt;</p><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="ida8ym4hlxc">How Did So Many People Become So Complacent?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id4ssxnaca9">The road ran by the side of the lake, which became narrower as I approached my native town. I discovered more distinctly the black sides of Jura, and the bright summit of Mont Blanc. I wept like a child. &quot;Dear mountains! my own beautiful lake! how do you welcome your wanderer? Your summits are clear; the sky and lake are blue and placid. Is this to prognosticate peace, or to mock at my unhappiness?&quot;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idj2v892ppd">I fear, my friend, that I shall render myself tedious by dwelling on these preliminary circumstances; but they were days of comparative happiness, and I think of them with pleasure. My country, my beloved country! who but a native can tell the delight I took in again beholding thy streams, thy mountains, and, more than all, thy lovely lake!</p><ul class=""><li class="Bullet-Level-1-ListBl1"><p class="Bullet-Level-1-ListBl1" id="id65b8jwpps">Here we have a simple bulleted list, and this is the first item</p></li><li class="Bullet-Level-1-ListBl1"><p class="Bullet-Level-1-ListBl1" id="idop053anon">This is a middle item in a simple bulleted list</p></li><li class="Bullet-Level-1-ListBl1"><p class="Bullet-Level-1-ListBl1" id="idd7enowblz">This is the second middle item in a simple bulleted list</p></li><li class="Bullet-Level-1-ListBl1"><p class="Bullet-Level-1-ListBl1" id="idt7ewt1li1">This is the third middle item&#x2014;are you still following along?</p></li><li class="Bullet-Level-1-ListBl1"><p class="Bullet-Level-1-ListBl1" id="id5c6bqmpck">And here we have the final simple bulleted list item</p></li></ul><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1jh1tw7zl">Yet, as I drew nearer home, grief and fear again overcame me. Night also closed around; and when I could hardly see the dark mountains, I felt still more gloomily. The picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil, and I foresaw obscurely that I was destined to become the most wretched of human beings. Alas! I prophesied truly, and failed only in one single circumstance, that in all the misery I imagined and dreaded, I did not conceive the hundredth part of the anguish I was destined to endure. It was completely dark when I arrived in the environs of Geneva; the gates of the town were already shut; and I was obliged to pass the night at Secheron, a village at the distance of half a league from the city. </p><ol class=""><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idr6vvht63j">Here is a simple numbered list, and this is the first item</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="id955rnpb6j">Here is the first middle</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idyrmb0vl8q">And the middle middle</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="id5j6vuzhpg">Last middle!</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idn0booeea3">And last last.</p></li></ol><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idq0i7ymffj">The sky was serene; and, as I was unable to rest, I resolved to visit the spot where my poor William had been murdered. As I could not pass through the town, I was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at Plainpalais. During this short voyage I saw the lightning playing on the summit of Mont Blanc in the most beautiful figures. The storm appeared to approach rapidly, and, on landing, I ascended a low hill, that I might observe its progress. It advanced; the heavens were clouded, and I soon felt the rain coming slowly in large drops, but its violence quickly increased.</p><ol class=""><li class="Alpha-Level-1-ListAl1"><p class="Alpha-Level-1-ListAl1" id="ide2qhcn0pl">First item in a simple List Alpha</p></li><li class="Alpha-Level-1-ListAl1"><p class="Alpha-Level-1-ListAl1" id="idmi75p86f2">Middle item in a simple List Alpha</p></li><li class="Alpha-Level-1-ListAl1"><p class="Alpha-Level-1-ListAl1" id="idd2qj4brs2">Another middle item in List Alpha</p></li><li class="Alpha-Level-1-ListAl1"><p class="Alpha-Level-1-ListAl1" id="id35ag2x6i4">Third middle item!</p></li><li class="Alpha-Level-1-ListAl1"><p class="Alpha-Level-1-ListAl1" id="id4qigtkvcd">And this is the last item in the simple List Alpha</p></li></ol><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ide9d0kqruz">I quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm increased every minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash over my head.

I wish you had come three months ago, and then you would have found us all joyous and delighted.
