And you don&#x2019;t belong anywhere else.</p><p class="Epigraph-SourceEpisrc" id="idfgms64tsa">&#x2014;Tama Kieves</p></blockquote><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idmnj4t0cgg">I had arrived in Denver with a broken heart. Some months before, a seemingly chance encounter had brought me into a full-on soul-to-soul connection with a kindred spirit. That sense of suddenly being at home in another&#x2019;s presence. Of having known each other before. It had surprised and delighted me. In an instant, I saw many potential possibilities for a future &#x201C;us.&#x201D; It&#x2019;s something us manifestors are known for. We believe truly anything is possible and often visualize what we want. But in the time since, it became increasingly clear that this yummy possibility would not come to fruition after all. Bereft, I had woken from my fog and realized I wasn&#x2019;t going to get what I wanted here. Not with this guy anyway. Just in time for a scheduled cross-country conference, I carried my heavy-hearted disappointment onto the plane, along with my overloaded suitcase.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idx1mpdf9t9">It might seem like an odd or bold choice to start a book on manifestation by fully admitting a recent failure. A time I was way off. Featuring none other than &#x201C;the one that got away.&#x201D; You&#x2019;d be absolutely right to think that. And this wouldn&#x2019;t be the first time the words <span class="itali">odd</span> or <span class="itali">bold</span> would be used to describe me and my choices.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idkaum5fa0l">I mean, after all, shouldn&#x2019;t I be a glowing example of the perfect life? Every dream realized, every wish fulfilled, with nothing left to do but sit on a beach, drinking mai tais and counting my money while Mr. Right massages my feet?</p><p class="Blank-Space-BreakBsbrk" id="idzh2wwehfw">[blank]</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idcuird8kun">Well, dear readers / future manifestors / dream weavers, I have a much, much more interesting journey to share.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id42duyu40i">In the twenty-three years since I started actively creating what I wanted, my life has changed so dramatically, I can hardly recognize myself. I am happier, healthier, more prosperous, and more creative, and I love myself more than I ever knew was possible. And along the way, I&#x2019;ve also encountered every possible pitfall, wrong turn, and pure delusions that can greet you on this journey. The ego snafus. The things I created I wish I hadn&#x2019;t. The old stories and beliefs that got in the way. And I&#x2019;m going to share it all, along with steps for recognizing and healing these missteps. We all have them. The creative process is fraught with what can feel like failures. But what&#x2019;s fascinating is the &#x201C;mistakes&#x201D; end up being an essential part of uncovering your best life.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idtvn5pl7dy">Because the last thing the world needs is a self-help book that ultimately makes people feel bad about themselves. Not happening. Not on my watch!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idwi5vnco7b">So back in Denver, I&#x2019;d finished off the second day of the conference and had an hour free before I met a group for dinner. My hotel room had a comfy round love seat with ottoman and velour pillows. I curled up there with a blanket and my laptop, my eyes taking turns between a Netflix stand-up comedy special and the gentle snow blowing past the window. It had been an unusually warm winter in my home state of New Jersey, and I had been craving just this, snow.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idyn0xl4kzz">I glanced at my phone to check the time: 4:30 p.m. Thirty minutes until dinner.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddxl6pz9s9">It seemed like such a mundane act. Checking the time. Something I can do five hundred times a day. Wasn&#x2019;t exactly what one would expect for entrance into a supernatural experience. There were no drums beating, no chanting, no scent of incense in the air. No deities descended into the room, trumpets blaring, sharing profound news. But that&#x2019;s exactly what it ended up being.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idq2dbkr6pi">In my mind, I transported back in time to ten years before. I was sitting in my office where I was a counselor in a social service agency. At that point, I had been there for thirteen years, which was already five years too long. What had once been a dream job had turned into a nightmare. I had grown and evolved past what was conceivable in this setting. My approach to being in service to others had shifted, and I felt stifled, frustrated, and bored. There was no room for me to bring to the job what I was most passionate about. Outside of the office, I was learning everything I could on manifestation, energy, and healing. Reading books, meditating, praying, visualizing, tapping, balancing. All that ended at my office door.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idx60rncof0">In the meantime, the job description, CEO, funding, and the company itself had changed, none for the better. But within that ever-widening gap between who I was becoming and where I remained was that darn security with all its plain-Jane seduction. Paid vacation and holidays. Good benefits. And a guaranteed source of income, every two weeks, right on time. How could I possibly leave? I looked up at the clock: 4:30 p.m. Thirty more minutes. Thirty interminable minutes. Every day had become in some ways the same day, and my adventurous spirit was dying. I was either counting down the minutes to freedom or the days until a holiday or a vacation. I spent each lunch hour numbing out to what I affectionately called &#x201C;online travel porn,&#x201D; watching other people visit exotic countries, hike through jungles, share gourmet meals with new friends, essentially living the kind of life I wanted to live. And here I was, staring at the clock, waiting for 5:00 p.m. and the temporary freedom on the other side of it.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idwebraf4e3">Then in an instant, I snapped back into the present day. My mind, heart, and body became flooded with gratitude and love. Here I was, 4:30 on a Tuesday, curled up in a beautiful room, in a lively city I had never been to and always wanted to visit, laughing and savoring the sweetness of it all. Here I was, in a hotel filled with loving, kind, fellow manifestors, spending my day listening to heart-opening live music and inspirational talks, my travel paid for. On an ordinary Tuesday! Can you believe it? Here I was, counting down the minutes to join sweet friends for a farm-to-table dinner, where we would share deep appreciation for one another in a way that brought tears to my eyes. One would mention a particularly valuable quality he felt I brought to our team&#x2019;s efforts, and I was awakened by it. Here, I learned something new about myself. Here I was, in a career I cherished, helping others in the ways I know truly work and sharing the good news of that to anyone who would listen. Speaking, traveling, teaching, and sharing healing on stages, on podcasts, and in interviews. Here I was, living the life I had always wanted to live. This was it. I was and am here.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idt3vkl2icy">If I had a selfie stick and captured this, I have to tell you, the scene would not have appeared Instagram-worthy. No beach, no Mr. Right, no size 6, and honestly, the lighting in that room was just terrible. There wasn&#x2019;t even a fan to give me that sexy blowing-hair look. And remember, there were no mystical lights or signs. But I was exactly where I had always wanted to be. No time clock to punch. No waiting for the interminable minutes to tick by, rescuing me from my miserable reality. No numbing out to images of others&#x2019; lives.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id87ho9hjkw">My temporary heartache had had me distracted, focusing my mind and energy on the one thing in my life that wasn&#x2019;t working (yet). Perhaps that sounds familiar. Have you ever had a paper cut? Those painful little suckers will force your attention on lockdown. Here 99.9999 percent of your body is just fine, and you keep thinking about that paper cut. <span class="itali">W</span><span class="itali">hy doesn</span><span class="itali">&#x2019;</span><span class="itali">t the company just go paperless already?</span><span class="itali"> A</span><span class="itali">nd this wouldn</span><span class="itali">&#x2019;</span><span class="itali">t have happened if they had lotion in the restrooms, and I really should be drinking more water or my skin wouldn</span><span class="itali">&#x2019;</span><span class="itali">t be this dry, and how come nobody seems to be able to create</span><span class="itali"> a softer paper?</span><span class="itali"> </span><span class="itali">A</span><span class="itali">nd man, this really hurts! And</span><span class="itali">&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.</span><span class="itali"> </span><span class="itali">and</span><span class="itali">&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.</span><span class="itali"> </span><span class="itali">and</span><span class="itali">&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. </span>You could stay trapped in that loop forever!</p><p class="Blank-Space-BreakBsbrk" id="idt3trd77gh">[blank]</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idkc0z88pwn">A divine intervention generously cut through my despair and reminded me of what I had lost sight of. I have created&#x2014;and will continue creating&#x2014;the life I&#x2019;ve always wanted. And I&#x2019;ve done that using the very principles, practices, and skills I am sharing here. All in a no-nonsense, no-BS, no-squeaky-shiny-image kind of way.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idpzxg2w0zd">Becoming a manifestor meant becoming more of my true self, with all my edges, weirdness, and ultra-realness coming into hyper-focus. I&#x2019;ll leave the Kardashians and the rest of the influencers to their soul purposes. They know what they&#x2019;re doing.

Maybe when you were growing up, your needs and desires weren&#x2019;t met, ignored or even shunned. Maybe you experienced a disappointment with a heartbreak or other loss. Those longings got buried under settling. Settling for what is, what&#x2019;s easy, what&#x2019;s around. But those desires are still within you, awaiting your attention.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idgytxba3w3">Here&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;ve learned about settling. As a former safe player, settling was always appealing to me. &#x201C;Just accept what is, Kris. This ________ (job, love, opportunity) may not be what you really wanted. But at least it&#x2019;s ________ (here now, available, being offered). Be grateful already! Who are you to expect more?&#x201D; And then a most unsettling thing would happen each time I settled. The yeses, the checked boxes, the good parts about what I had settle for would change. The seemingly loyal but selfish boyfriend mocked me to a mutual friend. The job&#x2019;s great benefits became less great, then not so good, then nonexistent. I would observe helplessly as what met a few of my needs was slowly eroded.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id612ecud0p">You always end up settling for less than what you originally planned for.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2va0ugv4q">I&#x2019;m going to say this: Take a chance on more. Take a chance that there is a benevolent force for good in the Universe and you can work with it. Take the risk! You are worth it.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idgvkaed5n7">And if you&#x2019;re still asking why you should bother, here are points to consider.</p><p class="B-HeadBhead" id="idou7vdcwsg"><span class="boldb">The Status Quo is Overrated</span></p><blockquote data-type="epigraph" class=""><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="idkyj037l62">To live is the rarest thing in the world.

As it is, right now. You can be grateful for all that you have now, and I encourage this. It doesn&#x2019;t mean you can&#x2019;t also desire more. Status quo = the same. The same = safe. Safe = boring. Safe = unfulfilling. Safe = potential passing you by. Safe = believing you don&#x2019;t deserve more. No matter who you are, no matter what life looks like for you, I&#x2019;m happy to share that there is more available.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ide54c9fjp8">Every single person who ever advanced civilization forward, whether that was in areas of entertainment, arts, politics, social justice, science, technology, economics, philosophy, agriculture, and more, was someone who decided there could be another way.

Want to change the world? Changing yourself creates change in the field, affecting everyone. When enough people live from this place, radical positive change will occur across the globe. Closer to home, the relationships with the people in your immediate circle begin to shift. Empowered people empower others. Changed people know change isn&#x2019;t only possible, it&#x2019;s actually quite doable.

And even attempting to keep anything the same won&#x2019;t work. The Universe is always in a state of expansion. Have you ever watched an old movie, like say from the &#x2019;50s? I like to do this every now and again because it&#x2019;s an example of the prevailing technology, beliefs, culture, and yes, consciousness of the time. In 1998, when director Gus Van Sant decided to create a shot-by-shot remake of the classic Hitchcock film <span class="itali">Psycho</span><span class="itali">,</span> I knew it wouldn&#x2019;t work. Life had changed dramatically since the original was released. The results were a stiff, stilted, and not-scary facsimile. It tried to re-create a product of that time and space. Going backward never produces anything meaningful. It moves against the forward flow of energy. So if you&#x2019;re here to grow, then why not grow consciously? If you don&#x2019;t, you may be faced with situations where growth feel forced upon you. You are always working with Universal laws, whether you want to or not.

There are things you want that you don&#x2019;t now have. A new computer. Money for a vacation. A job you love. A love you&#x2019;d love. Attracting these items into your life is a very good thing. How happy you are is the only success quotient there is. A new computer will make almost every project in your life easier. A vacation offers relaxation, fun, a much-needed break, which boosts health and mood. You spend many hours each work at your job. How joyous will that feel when your vocation is an ideal fit? A love helps you experience the Universe&#x2019;s love in human form. Everything you want is because of how it will make you feel. Having what you want feels good.

When that happens, we can lack trust in life and ourselves. Manifesting helps develop a rock-solid trust. Trust in yourself to create a better, more enjoyable, more meaningful life. Then you develop trust in the Higher Power of Your Own Understanding. To learn that there is this source of all this is or could ever be, and it&#x2019;s here for you, listening and providing for you&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. That. Changes. Everything.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idwhk24fpa0">I remember it like it was yesterday. I was twenty-seven years old and taking a workshop to change unconscious beliefs. We learned and worked with affirmations, visualizations, and self-hypnosis. Even though I had been on a spiritual journey since I was a young child, my life at this point was not working well for me, I was currently unemployed, and I had grown cynical. Well, cynical and even more desperate. The desperation overrode my pessimism long enough to find practices to change my life. In this workshop, while doing a guided visualization, I became aware of this feeling in my chest. It was both completely new to me and somehow entirely familiar. This tender, sweet, encompassing warmth spread throughout my body, bringing a profound realization. I began to cry. I knew. I was loved. Me? <span class="itali">Me. </span>I couldn&#x2019;t believe it. Me with all my insecurities, mistakes, and fears. Me for whom nothing ever seemed to work out. Me who felt like the forever oddball, the black sheep, the one least likely to succeed. An instantaneous shift happened that changed me forever. Brain cells were reorganized. Everything up until that moment stopped. I knew. The Universe was real. Like really real. It was a true revelation. An odd confession, I realize, from a person who was grasping at any possible spiritual solution available. But until then, the Universe was just a concept. A set of ideas. A mental construct based on all I had been exposed to and then explored. Those explorations were based on other people&#x2019;s experiences of a Higher Power, not my own. This force was something I hoped existed, but in all honesty, I didn&#x2019;t know that it did. I hadn&#x2019;t even admitted that to myself. Until that moment in time.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idc2pstqg9h">And I have witnessed so often in the lives of many how the difference between sickness and health, addiction and sobriety, lack and abundance, is exactly this. That inner realization, revelation, spiritual truth that each of us is indeed loved. We are never alone.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idf4ua05ynq">Finding this, in your own time and way, is worth the time, the energy, and yes, the risks. On your manifesting journey, it begins with developing that highly personal communication with a force that responds. You work with the language of words, feelings, mental images, and actions; you are communicating who you are and what you want. Asking for guidance, reading signs, and receiving intuitive information is how the Universe speaks back. From this, you develop the most important relationship you can ever have. It&#x2019;s both the one with your truest self and the Higher Power of All That Is. You will uncover that they are one in the same.</p><blockquote data-type="epigraph" class=""><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="id3makuhuew">Without leaps of imagination, or dreaming, we lose the excitement of possibilities.

If you think life is tough, you will be proved correct too.</p><p class="Epigraph-SourceEpisrc" id="id309s39jp4">&#x2014;Anita Moorjani</p></blockquote><aside data-type="sidebar" class=""><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="idd2ko3zdka"><span class="boldb">Quick Bit Alchemy List: 21 Amazing Manifestors Who Inspire Me</span></p><ol class=""><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="iddtd4irtdz">Bruce Springsteen</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idj8bcvn8d6">Catherine Ponder</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="id94w5bvtam">The Dalai Lama</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idts8b6n18r">Danielle LaPorte</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idxxf1km325">David Bowie</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idvlf5o0sar">Deepak Chopra</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="id40pyemuiv">Gary Craig</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="id2wxxhakqm">Gregg Braden</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idp88v26huh">Henry David Thoreau</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idbibw6f9ub">Saint Hildegard of Bingen</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idg1vwyuhov">Dr. Joe Dispenza</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="id8glhm46ij">Kate Sessions</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idhon35u6fq">Oprah Winfrey</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idulxgsxar4">Marianne Williamson</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idooxa8fedm">Myrtle and Charles Fillmore</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idbrhibmo5c">Napoleon Hill</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idjq8zod7xz">Nikola Tesla</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idzy5uj4skg">Ralph Waldo Emerson</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idks1yfauy1">Saint Padre Pio</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="id23k3qvxe1">Salvador Dal&#xED;</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idf13bx2kix">Wayne Dyer</p></li></ol></aside><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="ideh2jp4trs"><span class="boldb">We </span><span class="boldb">A</span><span class="boldb">re </span><span class="boldb">H</span><span class="boldb">ere to </span><span class="boldb">G</span><span class="boldb">row</span></p><blockquote data-type="epigraph" class=""><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="id63vsgvx56">We must be willing to let go of the life we planned so as to have the life that is waiting for us.</p><p class="Epigraph-SourceEpisrc" id="id6b8pnq4j2">&#x2014;Joseph Campbell</p></blockquote><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id7y65k0s2m">Why are we here?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ids4gypi3z7">This is a question I don&#x2019;t believe everyone asks themselves, not once in an entire lifetime. There are people who are content to be born, grow up, get a job, have a family, and retire without ever asking, &#x201C;Why me? Why was I born? What am I doing here?&#x201D; That&#x2019;s a perfectly fine way to make a go of life. There are times I still wish I had been one of those people. Like when I&#x2019;m hectic with a deadline looming and I look over at my napping cat Ling. Forever Zen, she opens her sleepy eyes, yawns, glances my way, and the look is always the same, &#x201C;What&#x2019;s wrong <span class="itali">now</span>?&#x201D; She doesn&#x2019;t get it. The existential crises, the tightrope walks over rocky terrain. She lives in acceptance and rhythm. All is right in her world, every single day. The animals have it all figured out. Me, not so much. I chide myself, &#x201C;Why, oh, why can&#x2019;t this be me? I could drop out of life right now and go scrub floors in an ashram!&#x201D; The voice of my overwhelm always offers solutions that include, one, leaving my entire life behind for, two, some kind of obedient spiritual job in the middle of nowhere. Pulling potatoes in a monastery garden. Being chief dishwasher in a convent. And I detest doing dishes! Can you imagine how desperate I would feel to consider such a thing? And if I shared those ideas with anyone who knows me, I&#x2019;d be confronted with a mixture of shock and hilarity. Because I will never be a simple-life kind of gal. I&#x2019;d last mere minutes before tearing off my robes, throwing them in the wood-burning stove, and yelling, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m out of here!&#x201D; stomping out in those hideously functional boots. This would likely occur during a time of silence. Thankfully, I wasn&#x2019;t born to adopt anyone else&#x2019;s idea of who I am and what an ideal spiritual life looks like. And you weren&#x2019;t either. Manifesting at its best is becoming more and more of yourself, even in ways that can astonish you.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id3kz1tzj8l">When I&#x2019;m not seeking escape, I&#x2019;m positively thrilled my calling has been to unleash a Conscious Cocreator, a Miracle Receiver, and Mischievous Manifestor. After all, I was born ruminating on the big questions. As I young child, I remember seeing a copy of <span class="itali">National Geographic.</span> It contained glorious photos of the Milky Way. I remember thinking, <span class="itali">Who are we and why are we here?</span> Feel a bit of compassion for my poor parents. They didn&#x2019;t quite know what to do with me. Thank God I received a fervent curiosity for finding answers to go along with those deep questions. On the power days, the bold and beautiful days, when everything is flowing my way, I sneer, &#x201C;Guess what, status quo? You can bite me! I didn&#x2019;t come here to follow the crowd. I&#x2019;m advancing civilization forward. And you&#x2019;re welcome!&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idbrcz8g6o8">I don&#x2019;t believe we are just clumps of clustered cells with a heartbeat. I know with certainty we are not the blabbering nonsense of our monkey minds. That&#x2019;s a relief! There were times I thought I was my crippling anxiety and fears. Got to watch out for those. They&#x2019;re very convincing. But within me, there has always been a deeper knowing. I didn&#x2019;t learn it from my parents, school, or church. It&#x2019;s always just been there, a soft assurance, a whisper of more. Imagine a compass, a lighthouse, a movable manifesto written in poetry and song, all calling me forward, beckoning me to look beyond what I see with my eyes. It&#x2019;s been there all along.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idvltvc4gw3">When I ask, why I&#x2019;m here, at this time, at this place, in a body, doing what I do, the best answers are obvious. And they start with more specific questions.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iduvc07in8i">What gives me joy? (Lifelong learning, creative projects realized, dancing.) What unleashes a zeal and passion within me for living? (Healing, belief in possibilities, travel.) What gets me up in the morning? (My vocation, desire to help, time with people I love.)</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idehqu3z7z1">Conversely, when I&#x2019;m dragging myself out of bed, what&#x2019;s the problem? (Exhaustion, overscheduling, feeling misunderstood.) What qualities in others makes me light up? (Openness, depth, trustworthiness.) When do I experience something greater than myself? (In prayer, nature, and the beauty of art, music, and design.)</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idxsnvaxp22">Because that&#x2019;s what makes life juicy and satisfying for me. Love. Purpose. Service. Expansion. Humor. Connection. Empowerment. Peace. Beauty. These qualities may be similar for you, and at the same time, your examples may appear completely unique. Your vocation or the one you&#x2019;re seeking to create will reflect your soul&#x2019;s purpose, not mine. Your awe-inspiring nature experiences may be near the ocean while mine are in the mountains. And nature is our value. If I could poll a million people with these same questions, I can guarantee the answers would fall in the categories above. This would be regardless of country, culture, beliefs, or religion. Because they are Universal truths, inherent within all life. We can never be separated from them. And none of these qualities can be identified in a blood test. Your doctor will never say, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry, but your tests indicate you are dangerously low on joy.&#x201D; And quite frankly, I&#x2019;d welcome a day when doctors can share spiritual concerns such as this. Because as I shared, we are more than just a clump of cells. And what can bring us to the doctor&#x2019;s office&#x2014;or bankruptcy court, for that matter&#x2014;can have a great deal to do with spiritual deficits. And if those deficits aren&#x2019;t addressed by your doctor or lawyer, their solutions for you may be temporary. Spiritual principles and practices are the perfect accompaniment to everything you&#x2019;re doing to heal and feel and live better. And until your doctor and lawyer are trained on these matters, it&#x2019;s time for you to step up and be your own spiritual teacher. You can become so effective at manifesting a happy, healthy life, you may not need them so much anymore anyway!</p><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="idvdun3gr47"><span class="boldb">Manifesting Reflection Questions on Purpose</span></p><ol class=""><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idezin4gop5">Why do you believe you are here?</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="iduyqnhddry">What gives you joy?</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="id0tx6fbws4">You wake up one day filled with excitement.

What you put in is what you get out.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1y7hesqr9">I&#x2019;m going to show you how to work with this force to create a life that makes you sing. There will be times that work looks like you&#x2019;re lassoing a bucking bronco. Other times you will kneel before it in trusting sweet surrender. You will be consciously working with the Creator of All That Is. An all-knowing force that knows you better than you know yourself.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idvrnlvqwos">When you show up to create knowing this, the work goes beyond just the stuff. Inner talents and strengths are unveiled within you that you had no idea were there. You develop deep faith, in yourself, in your worthiness, and your ability to be more of who you truly are. And you develop faith in that Higher Power to support, guide, and love you.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idbvyjnn0h3">You realize you are never truly alone.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idq817yb7nt">For this book, I&#x2019;ll use the term <span class="itali">Universe.</span> In my experience, this word seems the least triggering to the largest number of people. It&#x2019;s sciencey. It has no gender. And the connotation infers all-encompassing. It&#x2019;s also simply shorter than using Higher Power of Your Own Understanding. Yet, please know, Higher Power of Your Own Understanding (HPYOU) is exactly what I mean.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id7deqw72um">Where you see <span class="itali">Universe</span> in this book, feel free to mentally exchange that word for one that works for you. If you&#x2019;re coming into this work with already lovingly held beliefs on a Higher Power, use the term that helps you feel your connection to It. If that&#x2019;s God, that&#x2019;s beautiful. For some, the &#x201C;G-word&#x201D; has negative connotations. Maybe you were taught God is to be feared and that feels threatening to you. Then the word <span class="itali">God</span> is not your term. If you come from a religious background with a deity, then by all means, go with that. If you&#x2019;re generally spiritual, work with what you&#x2019;ve used before. And if you&#x2019;re uncertain about all this and feeling flexible, experiment with what to call It. <span class="itali">Higher Self</span> is an excellent option for the more secularly minded. What helps you feel the love that is all around you? Spirit, Source, Life, Divine Love, Essence, Eternity, Great One, Lord, Father, Divine Mother. There are friends of mine who call it the <span class="itali">Unseen Therapist</span> and swear by this term. If you&#x2019;re feeling bold, come up with something on your own. &#x201C;Make up a word for the Higher Power of My Own Understanding?&#x201D; Yes, that&#x2019;s exactly what I&#x2019;m saying. As your relationship with the HPYOU grows, the terminology you use becomes the doors. Doors to connection. Doors to bliss. Doors to blessings. Paint, adorn, and label that door so it&#x2019;s inviting to you.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idhptsy1lod">I ended getting oddly traditional about all this. After test-driving an array of Higher Power Words from multiple disciplines over many years, I ended up back at <span class="itali">God.</span> It was very surprising to me. Here I was, a true spiritual rebel in every sense of the word, and I was not having a relationship with Deva or Brahman or the Flying Spaghetti Monster, but God? Seriously? But that&#x2019;s what worked for me. I learned the word itself didn&#x2019;t need to change. I had to let go of old conditioning and ideas I had about It, like the whole &#x201C;old man in the sky&#x201D; thing. The &#x201C;has a gender&#x201D; thing. Oh, and the punishing-condemnation thing too. And definitely the hating certain kinds of people myth. Yeah, none of that ever felt right and true, not even when I was a small child. Once my ideas about God came into resonance with what I intuitively understood as spiritual truths, I had what I needed. My doorway. And what I love about it is that word is just everywhere. On bumper stickers, billboards, journal covers, and in conversations. It does not matter if the bumper sticker owner and I are on the same theological page. For that moment, I feel a connection to the Higher Power of My Own Understanding&#x2014;and to them, whoever they may be. If it helps me to love all people, well, then that&#x2019;s what God is supposed to be about.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id911oxwn1t">I don&#x2019;t care what you call It. I just care that you call on It.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idqks1k5upw">The Universe can feel highly impersonal. You focus on what you want. Create feelings that support that. Focus on the good.

You and everyone else on the planet. We all get to work with it to create what we want.

You&#x2019;ve been searching for years online for a limited print by artist Shepard Fairey. Finally, it&#x2019;s yours! Now framed and gracing a place of honor in your home, you soon walk past it without even a glance.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idy835hkkfi">Things are good. Good to want, good to get.

You give them valued importance in your mind and heart.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idgcpcjbb8p">That&#x2019;s the kind of relationship I&#x2019;d like you to have with the Universe.

You may even want to enlist the support of a manifesting buddy, who&#x2019;d like to create a change themselves, so you can work these processes together. Or simply find an accountability partner. This is a person you make an agreement with to accomplish a specific task. Check in with them to let them know when you do and don&#x2019;t accomplish what was agreed upon. You can even form a book group and work the principles and practices together. What I love most about enlisting others is you get support when challenged and a celebration when succeeding. It feels so good to celebrate!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2c8l0f1ss">Get a cheap, thick notebook, lined or unlined, your choice.

Popular movies, talk shows, and books have urged us over and over again to create the life of our dreams. With social media, we get reminder-memes, with sayings like:</p><blockquote class="looseextract"><p class="Extract1Ext1" id="idn092m091j">&#x201C;Whatever you&#x2019;re thinking, you&#x2019;re attracting.&#x201D;</p><p class="Extract1Ext1" id="idkmi2exsrj">&#x201C;Keep putting out good.

Even knowing that, you may have noticed, it&#x2019;s just plain easier to focus on problems, what&#x2019;s not working, everything out of place or seemingly out of reach. This is our humanness at work. It&#x2019;s pure biology. The human system is designed to survive, not necessarily thrive. As long as we keep breathing, moving, and eating, the chances for us to reproduce increases, and our species lives on. Except many of us are living in places and cultures where everyday physical survival is not a concern. Your human system does not know this. It has no idea that there is a Starbucks on every corner, awaiting to fuel your caffeine binge. It cares nothing for your soul&#x2019;s fulfilment. It believes your needs could not be met at every possible moment, and it would like you to be hyperaware of that, thank you very much. So if we don&#x2019;t have enough money in our account to pay a bill that has come due, that survival mechanism gets activated. You know logically you will not spontaneously combust if the payment is late. Unfortunately, our human systems are not built for modern life. No matter how hard you try, you can&#x2019;t stop thinking about it. <span class="itali">I can</span><span class="itali">&#x2019;</span><span class="itali">t believe this. I don</span><span class="itali">&#x2019;</span><span class="itali">t get paid until a week from Friday. And most of that is already spent. I</span><span class="itali">&#x2019;</span><span class="itali">m going to get hit with a late charge.</span> These thoughts will likely have activated some uncomfortable feelings within you like shame or guilt or even anxiety. You are now consumed with what you don&#x2019;t want to experience more of.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idimf3aktr6">Lack. Scarcity. Life is showing you &#x201C;not enough&#x201D; and you&#x2019;re having a difficult time focusing on anything else.</p><p class="B-HeadBhead" id="idiitbig79l"><span class="boldb">Driven to Distraction</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idrr6567z2z">I was an attention deficit disorder (ADD) kid before it had a definition or a name. I would sit for hours each evening at my family&#x2019;s dining room table trying to complete my homework, while my mind bounced from thought to thought. Almost none of these thoughts were on the task before me. I was prone to daydreaming and drifting off, especially when I was bored. Later, on my spiritual path, I could flit around from book to teacher to philosophy, a total workshop junkie, because focus was such a challenge for me. I was forever chasing the next shiny object.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idlbtn2nrvd">There are two approaches to focus needed for manifesting:</p><ol class=""><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idrl2tyzgjg">1. A long, focused session</p><p class="Num-Level-1-List-ParagraphNl1p" id="id1irfdbcd8">You put aside an hour or free afternoon to tackle one or more processes for achieving your goals.</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="id6raxosvxv">2. Micro-dosing</p><p class="Num-Level-1-List-ParagraphNl1p" id="idlj8galfr1">Every day, two or more times per day, you stop, focus, and do a process. It may last one to ten minutes.</p></li></ol><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idxd50uid98">Based on what&#x2019;s natural for me, I used to apply the long approach. One of the secrets of being an ADD person is many of us can be hyper-focused for periods of time. Like the building next door is on fire and we don&#x2019;t hear sirens or smell smoke kind of focus. When I fully apply myself to what&#x2019;s before me, I can go for long periods and get a lot done. However, I have found approach number two to be far more effective. Not being a fan of interruptions, this surprised me. Yet several bursts of creative focus made manifesting both faster and easier. And those shorter bursts never added up to the time I would have spent weekly. Regular manifesting reprograms us for success. The long versus the micro-dosing approach can depend on practices. No one is going to create a vision board in five minutes. But once that project is set up, micro-dosing to &#x201C;work the board&#x201D; can be a good idea.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idwnm6qrpoc">It seems like our technological age has inspired ADD-like qualities in just about everyone. We carry around this small device that enables us to read a news story, chat with our Australian friend, apply for a job, share our vacation photos, and answer an email, all within the span of ten minutes. We gather instantaneous responses or reports. Our brains get hooked on all that immediacy. This device has creeped into movie theaters, restaurants, and even our bedrooms. We can&#x2019;t talk about focus without talking about our phones.</p><p class="B-HeadBhead" id="idk1uyhbusf"><span class="boldb">Getting Your Smart</span><span class="boldb">p</span><span class="boldb">hone to Work with You Instead of Against You</span><span class="boldb">: Set Limits</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idp0iy2zxg4">If your mind keeps drifting to your phone as you try to affirm, meditate, or visualize yourself into a brighter future, manifestation practices won&#x2019;t be as effective as they can be.</p><ol class=""><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idwo8lhiubb">1. Turn it off.</p><p class="Num-Level-1-List-ParagraphNl1p" id="idd8y9yffof">I know. The world may be coming to an end and you&#x2019;re just sitting there, imagining your dream lover, with no way for anyone to contact you. This is where a little trust comes in. Trust that if there&#x2019;s anything you really need to know, the Universe will give you a heads-up. I have certainly gotten divine taps on the shoulder in meditations. And when you live your life moving with the flow of energy, timing just works. You have an inner call receiver that the Universe can utilize at any time. It&#x2019;s what people used in the centuries before phones. This will help stretch your intuition muscles.</p><p class="Num-Level-1-List-ParagraphNl1p" id="idxszs0mke8">I recommend this for your practices, of course, but not just during your manifesting time. Turn it off when having dinner with a friend. Turn it off at night. Every night or almost. When I mentioned I do this to a friend, she was aghast. &#x201C;What if there&#x2019;s an emergency and you can&#x2019;t be reached?&#x201D; I told her I have made it all the way to midlife and there&#x2019;s never been anything that&#x2019;s happened at 3:00 a.m. that it wasn&#x2019;t okay to hear about at 7:00. Now, certain circumstances, like a child attending their first sleepover, or a loved one sick in the hospital, may warrant temporary changes. Make sure those changes are temporary.</p><p class="Num-Level-1-List-ParagraphNl1p" id="idz4qrl3do0">Once you get into a habit of turning your phone off on a regular basis, even if just for ten-minute intervals, I promise, it will be a relief to you. It sends a signal to the brain to stop thinking about the phone. Otherwise, part of your awareness is always waiting on the next ping. Now all of you is available. You will need that energy to create.</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="id9419qowii">2.

That may look like what is generally considered inspirational: glowing sunsets, blooming flowers, and light parting pristine clouds in the sky. My phone is filled with many just like that. And you may spot an unconventional scene that gives you peace or makes you feel joy. Be open to engaging in the world around you, looking for inspiration everywhere. The key is, not what you think you should be inspired by but what truly positively impacts you. This can be quite unique to you. My camera roll also holds images of urban graffiti, piles of dead leaves, and Vancouver recycling bins. To each their own. Scenic trips offer countless opportunities, and yet so does a regular trip to the supermarket. I like to linger in the produce and flower sections, taking in the colors and textures. And yes, often snapping shots to savor later.</p></li><li class="Bullet-Level-2-ListBl2"><p class="Bullet-Level-2-ListBl2" id="idlyz2ynw6d">Not a picture taker?

Now use feeling words like <span class="itali">freedom, abundance, passion,</span> and <span class="itali">peace.</span> Search for a famous person who has manifested what you&#x2019;d like to create.

This is an easy place to get stuck in your creative process. Creating what you want feels frivolous, selfish, and that it won&#x2019;t make a difference in the big picture. You may feel consumed with the constant news cycle, adding mental evidence to all that isn&#x2019;t fair. You may have equated the idea of manifestation or even a general belief in something greater than yourself to checked-out, science-denying, kale-smoothy-drinking, conspiracy-loving bliss bunnies. For you, it&#x2019;s imperative you understand that everything is connected, so any big-picture changes you&#x2019;d like to see can only happen when many people make internal changes. Living an empowered life inside allows you to be a bigger change agent outside. Once you&#x2019;re earning the money you&#x2019;d like, you can donate to causes that are making a significant difference. Or take time off to volunteer. Remember that very university, hospital, and museum that exists was likely funded by a small group of wealthy people.

You may have tried to create what you wanted in the past and gotten easily discouraged, giving up before the creation was complete. You&#x2019;re protecting yourself from a fear of disappointment and fostering feelings of low self-esteem. You imagine everything that can go wrong while disregarding what could go right. You want to maintain control so you&#x2019;ll get a guaranteed outcome before proceeding. But on some level, that&#x2019;s not how the creative process works. For you, building confidence in yourself and the Universe will be key. Starting small on your manifesting journey will help you to slowly build to taking larger risks with your deepest desires. And start affirming your self worth now, even if it feels ridiculous. In time, that will change.</p><p class="Unnum-Level-1-List-ParagraphUl1p" id="id1zmmz1hvq">If you scored mostly Cs, you&#x2019;re likely a:</p><p class="Unnum-Level-1-List-ParagraphUl1p" id="idna4mc0540"><span class="boldb">Wishy</span><span class="boldb">-</span><span class="boldb">Washy Waffler</span></p><p class="Unnum-Level-1-List-ParagraphUl1p" id="id3caciwfe7">You think you can have this.

Easily distracted, you may begin chasing the next dream while abandoning the current project. The problem is, soon after, the next dream will be abandoned as well. Lack of consistency and indecisiveness are your biggest weaknesses. For you, making a firm decision and sticking to it will likely flush out those bad habits or unconscious beliefs that are getting in your way. If in the process of manifesting something, you get bored, rededicate yourself to this goal anyway. Find the passionate feelings for it once again.

They are agreements that define a desired result, the means to creating it, the time frame for completion, and the repercussions for not doing so. You wouldn&#x2019;t think of having your kitchen remodeled or website created without one. If the idea of a contract with yourself feels rigid or stifling, then I&#x2019;m going to strongly encourage you to try this. Conscious creation requires your commitment and a foundation on which inspiration can build. Think of the contract not as a punishing tool but a concrete reminder on how to best rise up for yourself and your desires.</p><p class="B-HeadBhead" id="idcpn0hsb53"><span class="boldb">How to Use It</span></p><ol class=""><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idnpolyvqwe">1. Times. Create a definite start and end time. This is the time frame in which you will do the practices outlined, not for the manifestation to happen. To build self-confidence, particularly if you feel you haven&#x2019;t lived up to commitments you&#x2019;ve made to yourself in the past, start small. What can you commit to doing for a week? After that week is complete, create a new contract and expand the time frame.</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="iddqoi2w6bf">2. Areas. Choose one area in your life to start manifesting.</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idjqa3vknbh">3. What You Want. Write briefly about what you&#x2019;d like to experience in this area. I say <span class="itali">briefly</span> because you will be getting clearer, refining and perhaps even redefining as the process unfolds.</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idfs1vp0nye">4. Practices. Choose a practice (or two or three) you feel drawn to and can help you get focused and feel the feelings of this creation.</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="id4ihh5vw1n">5. Duration. Agree to a duration for these practices. Daily, weekly, monthly. Ten minutes or an hour. This will vary according to the practices themselves and your schedule. I strongly encourage you to create time for these activities. Think of the time you spend online and watching TV. Use some of that for creating. And don&#x2019;t overschedule with these activities either. If you make it arduous, you&#x2019;ll soon find reason not to do it! Get specific and use a timer.</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idcmvt15f0x">6. Repercussions. Just like with any contract, if you don&#x2019;t do what is agreed, there will be penalties. Perhaps you donate to a favorite charity or add twenty minutes to your daily walk. Maybe you forgo TV for a week. When you don&#x2019;t meet a commitment to yourself, the repercussions are not punishments but rather another opportunity to now keep your word. They should be strong enough that you feel them, but do choose healthy and life-affirming penalties over anything self-abusive. This is extremely important. If you recognize you didn&#x2019;t honor the contract, be kind to yourself, then follow up on the consequences. Do not use this process to think or speak harshly to yourself.</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idf6mo8tp63">7. Affirmations. Use the contract to affirm your worthiness and ability to do this!</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="ide6zysy76s">8. Signature and Witness. Sign and print your name. Can I get a witness? Yes, get a (kind, supportive) witness to read this contract and sign along with you.

Every few days, in utter frustration, we&#x2019;d plead with our landlord. He&#x2019;d call the plumber, who would arrive in a maroon work van. Often I&#x2019;d sit on the front porch waiting for the cavalry to arrive, for that maroon van. After that, I began seeing maroon vans everywhere. Each time, I&#x2019;d think, <span class="itali">That must be our plumber</span><span class="itali">,</span> and pull up alongside only to find it never was. It just seemed like our entire town was suddenly overrun with the exact kind of maroon van he drove. I had focused on the van so intensely, I not only trained myself to see them but was also attracting them into my experience. Once the repairs were finally completed, I stopped looking for the vans, and they stopped showing up on the road in front of me.

The hostess is a good friend, but you find her spouse insufferable. Normally, you&#x2019;d spend the drive home laughing about every time he bragged, interrupted, or dominated the conversation. You honestly have no idea how she stands him! Usually, the focus of conversation would be on him. From there, it would likely spiral into the fact you had to park ten blocks away, there were too many unfamiliar people, and you honestly would have preferred to stay home.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idtlinapeja">Instead, turn the conversation to all that was right. You loved your friend&#x2019;s dress. The food was delicious and healthy. Isn&#x2019;t it nice to go to a party where the food is so thoughtfully prepared? You&#x2019;d really like that vegan potato salad recipe. It was so interesting speaking with your friend&#x2019;s coworker on her time in the Peace Corps. The music mix was the perfect blend of upbeat without being overpowering. You were so happy they set up extra chairs so you didn&#x2019;t have to stand all night. They must have put a lot of energy, time, and money into creating a very special evening. You remember to call her tomorrow and thank her.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id3zpcf8iqs">It&#x2019;s the same evening. You didn&#x2019;t somehow rewind time and change anything that occurred. Upon reflection, you decided to bring a very different mindset to the experience. As you started to delve, you realized that so much good had been there after all.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idtnp6shemu">And here you are, beloved reader, taking in two perspectives on an imaginary scenario. How did you feel reading about the insufferable spouse? Remind you of anyone? I bet it did because we all know someone like that! Next, you read the positive review. How did that feel, just in reading it? I bet a whole lot better. Calmer. More peaceful. Like maybe you&#x2019;d enjoy an invite to just such an event. All from a party that did not even happen!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id6atendcic">If you have a partner, you may think they will never go along with it. Try it anyway. Without a lecture. No &#x201C;Honey, I think tonight we should focus on all the wonderful aspects of the party instead of securitizing Jim.&#x201D; That will bring up resistance. Your partner could feel wronged for a behavior you both engaged in. Don&#x2019;t take the bait. Just gently counter your partner&#x2019;s complaints with one of your positive observations. Ask questions based on those. &#x201C;I really enjoyed the food. Did you try the potato salad? How did you like it? What did you like best?&#x201D; Even if your partner does not share your opinions, they will be able to access the good vibes. You alone can shift the energy into an upward rise. Just keep focusing on the good and sharing it with enthusiasm.</p><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="idooa4r0bx5"><span class="boldb">Manifesting Mini Process</span><span class="boldb">: </span><span class="boldb">Upgrade Your Reviews</span></p><blockquote data-type="epigraph" class=""><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="idjno8j58ww">I can live for two months on a good compliment.</p><p class="Epigraph-SourceEpisrc" id="id9uam5y3q9">&#x2014;Mark Twain</p></blockquote><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idvnku7yy76">We live in a time where almost everything gets reviewed, from restaurants to Uber drivers to dentists.

You&#x2019;ll enter the supermarket seeking the positives, so you&#x2019;ll have something to write down. Now you&#x2019;re not only experiencing the good upon reflection but in the present moment as well. The more you do this, the better your everyday experiences become. It&#x2019;s easy to find the good during vacation; after all, that&#x2019;s the purpose for going on one. Imagine bringing that awareness to the everyday.

There was waiting until I lost weight (wait/weight, interesting, huh?), and waiting until I became ____________ (less anxious, more enlightened, more successful) to ease up, to be happy, to finally love myself. All it did was perpetuate more and more waiting. There was never a finish line. I was always moving the baton further and further ahead while I struggled to catch it. It constantly fed an energy of not having, not being good enough, and a total lack of appreciation for all I did indeed have. As a person with no patience whatsoever, this was maddening.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idp9jmskte0">Whatever you&#x2019;re seeking to create anything, stop waiting to experience the happiness you believe the manifestation will provide. Start creating the happiness right now.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idvtiv0frbu">I thought I needed a man to buy a house. Isn&#x2019;t that how it&#x2019;s supposed to work? Isn&#x2019;t that what I was told in movies and media? I kept waiting on Mr. Right to fulfill this dream. Sadly, decades of modern evidence to the contrary had not breached that belief in me. When I realized I was delaying my good, I decided to stop waiting. Many thought it couldn&#x2019;t be done. After all, I live in an area with very high housing costs and taxes. And I was on a social service salary at the time, no less. It didn&#x2019;t matter. I was determined, and I knew that I could create what I wanted.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idhwt7kqgeq">I first spoke with a real estate agent a friend introduced me to. I told him what I wanted. A two-bedroom house with a yard within a fifteen-minute commute to my job. He literally scoffed. &#x201C;Oh no, just no. You will never be able to find that with what you&#x2019;ve been approved for! Not in this area. And what do you want with a house anyway? You&#x2019;re single. I have a few condos I&#x2019;ll show you.&#x201D; And that was both the beginning and end of our professional relationship. I knew if he didn&#x2019;t believe it was possible for me to get what I wanted, it would not happen. I needed an agent who was on the same page. The next one said, &#x201C;Oh, we can find that for you!&#x201D; And we did. I learned of special mortgages for lower-income people that had many benefits, including a lower down payment and no PMI. I was quickly approved. As I sat down with the lawyer on signing day, he said, &#x201C;This is a really, really good interest rate. I haven&#x2019;t seen anyone in my office with an interest rate this low in years. Oh, this is a nice-size property. And the yard. That&#x2019;s a good-size yard! For this amount? In this town? I&#x2019;ve never seen anything like this.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idh1ed97x45">The funny thing is, after I bought the house, I met a tall, handsome, smart, and funny guy, and we had a happy, long-term relationship for many years.

Like a food association is a cheeseburger with french fries. They are lumped together so frequently, we think this is how it&#x2019;s supposed to be. I&#x2019;ll never forget when a friend practically melted down at a restaurant that served its burgers only with salads. &#x201C;This is simply an atrocity, Kris!&#x201D; she wailed.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idqxlx3n0zj">&#x201C;An <span class="itali">atrocity</span>?&#x201D; I countered as I started to laugh. But that&#x2019;s how firmly associations can become entrenched. Think of them as attachments that can get in your way.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idc1mfk1hjv">With waiting, we&#x2019;ve made an association between the manifestation and what will unfold after its arrival. When we engage in the outcomes first, that which we&#x2019;ve been putting off &#x201C;until&#x201D; sends signals to the Universe that we&#x2019;re ready now for the manifestation.

If you ever were left waiting for a loved one to arrive for a special event, you know these feelings. But what if every arrival happened right on time? Maybe not on human time but divine time. Now imagine the energy of quiet expectancy. You know it&#x2019;s coming. You know it will unfold in perfect timing. It simply <span class="itali">is</span> happening so you trust it will arrive right on time. And you softly open your arms to embrace it, whenever that is.

Or more appropriately, I could say they are most successful in creating it. This perpetual magnetic vibe emanates from their beings, saying, &#x201C;Yes, life, I deserve all this and more, more, more.&#x201D; You can be annoyed with those people, or you can become one of them. Trust me, for much of my life, encounters with these folks left me disgruntled and bitter. &#x201C;They&#x2019;re so selfish. It&#x2019;s all about them!&#x201D; That is, until I decided to become one myself. And low and behold, I have so much more to give now than I ever did before. This is an important vibe to cultivate within yourself.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idnc09oyfnb">Now, there are a lot of reasons why we don&#x2019;t feel deserving. There are beliefs in the collective consciousness about class, gender, sexual orientation, geographical location, and much more. Regardless of what&#x2019;s happening &#x201C;out there,&#x201D; you can only create change from the inside out. As we are all connected, what&#x2019;s happening in the world does have an effect on us when we are living unconsciously&#x2014;that is, until we make empowered choices and start creating from within rather than living the effects of the collective.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2qkfglcrf">Get rid of any old programming that&#x2019;s weighing you down. See chapter 24, &#x201C;Dealing with Doubts and Releasing Resistance.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id29ovc4uh4">And if you&#x2019;ve been waiting for someone to come along and say, &#x201C;You deserve good!&#x201D; then please, by all means, allow that person to be me.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iduq3whhlv1">You are a spark of divine life force energy. There will never be another unique you. You are deserving of a life worth rejoicing over. You don&#x2019;t help anyone or the world by being less. You are worthy to create and embrace a life that makes your heart sing with purpose and joy. You aren&#x2019;t just loved. You are love itself, in human form, here to create heaven on earth. At conception, one out of millions of sperm joined an egg and created you, the result that is the winning combination. Know this, and allow it to become your truth.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1jhwdfwgu">Now I&#x2019;m going to speak to those of you who may be observing current social trends toward narcissism and hubris. You think, <span class="itali">No way! I don</span><span class="itali">&#x2019;</span><span class="itali">t want to be like that.</span> Let me be clear. Healthy self-esteem and feeling worthy of a beautiful life will never look like unbridled greed, obsessive pettiness, or shallow vanity. Narcissists and others like them are actually deeply insecure, easily swayed by others&#x2019; opinions, and very much disempowered. This is not self-love. When you cultivate love and deservability from the inside out, you&#x2019;re living life from your true power, your spiritual essence.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idj2z94f93p">Start stretching your worthiness for good by becoming an open receiver.</p><p class="B-HeadBhead" id="idqwq4rgsvv"><span class="boldb">Receiving with Grace </span><span class="boldb">and</span><span class="boldb"> Appreciation</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idmzas0a5ps">You&#x2019;d like to receive more good from the Universe.

You&#x2019;re being acknowledged for anything from the stellar outfit you&#x2019;re wearing to a major accomplishment like earning a degree. Instead of beaming with healthy pride, you find yourself shrinking instead. There can be many reasons for this. Perhaps you were raised to believe it&#x2019;s better to give than receive. (Both are equally necessary. See more on page TK.) Maybe a compliment makes you feel like you&#x2019;re temporarily in the spotlight and you don&#x2019;t like the attention. The discomfort could be triggering a troublesome belief or distorted self-image. Please know, these can be healed. For now, remember this: when you decline a compliment, you are insulting the giver and shutting down your energetic flow. Stop, smile, say a sincere thank you, let the compliment in, and breathe into any discomfort until it passes.</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idywi8wc2sw">2.

An article in your Facebook feed that solves a dilemma for you. Good is all around when you&#x2019;re open to it. This will make you laugh. I literally pick up every penny I see on the ground. They are a unit of energy just like any other denomination. And I thank the Universe every single time! What most people have decided is an annoyance, to me is a gift. The more you receive these tiny blessings, the more you&#x2019;ll encounter and realize they aren&#x2019;t so random after all.</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="id40ft8mq4l">4.

Unlike with the not-valuable advice, which can bring in even more, receive this all with love. Even if the Instant Pot was dented or the chicken dry. There is always value to a gift in that someone was thinking of you. Appreciate the gesture even if the gift itself is the &#x201C;wrong size&#x201D;, metaphorically speaking.</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idq9oopgi0n">5.

Consciously receive it. The same goes for money given by friends, tips from customers, or gifts from family. If you&#x2019;re receiving unemployment benefits, consciously receive that too. The temptation can be to look at that amount and focus on it being too low or not what you&#x2019;re used to making. There may even be embarrassment. See this as an area for healing so you can appreciate every dollar without pain. Print out your checking account statement, and next to every deposit, write, &#x201C;Thank you, Universe.

If you&#x2019;re tempted to immediately return a compliment with a compliment or a gift for a gift, you are deflecting your receiving. In the discomfort, you are returning to your giving default. Immediate reciprocity is a rule of obligation, not receptivity or generosity. Yes, you will give back to life and make that a part of your practice. But who you give to may not look like the giver standing before you. Let yourself receive first, and acknowledge you are worthy of this and more.</p></li></ol><aside data-type="sidebar" class=""><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="idvbjotm0o0"><span class="boldb">Quick Bit Alchemy List: </span><span class="boldb">7 Easy Things to Do </span><span class="bold-italbi">Right Now</span><span class="boldb"> That Will Attract More Good</span></p><ol class=""><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="id76jo7v54e">1.

With the circles I run in of spiritual and bighearted people, there is an over-giving epidemic. I&#x2019;ve seen people I care about, exhausted, broke people, literally push money and support back as soon as it&#x2019;s offered. And they wonder why they are exhausted and broke!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idh1y648xg5">Giving and receiving are two parts of a cycle of flow. If you&#x2019;re an over-receiver, you&#x2019;re likely to feel guilty. And under-receivers often feel resentful. Allow the cycle to flow so you&#x2019;re becoming ever increasingly generous with both giving and receiving.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id4gk3wb6c3">Find ways to give what you most want to receive.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idyyenw1o67">Years ago, I had a series of boyfriends who shunned Valentine&#x2019;s Day. Suddenly, come the beginning of February, they&#x2019;d get extremely principled. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s just a made-up Hallmark holiday, Kris. It&#x2019;s just making us be over-consumers!&#x201D; I heard this, I&#x2019;m not kidding you, from three different beaus over five years, and they did not know each other. The only thing they had in common was me. And of course, the less anyone wanted to celebrate with me, the more, more, more I wanted it! The card, the candy, the flowers, oh my! Mine, mine, mine!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idaooeere49">Choosing to be single for a while, I worked on upgrading my romantic standards. It was time for a different kind of man. When that first solo Valentine&#x2019;s Day approached, I was filled with dread. Rather than drowning in a bottle of wine, I knew I had three choices. Ignore it (not so easy), hate it (too easy!), or turn it around (man, do I like a challenge!) I decided to give what I hadn&#x2019;t been receiving. I chose five single gal pals and made a Valentine&#x2019;s Day I knew they wouldn&#x2019;t forget. I created gorgeous gift baskets filled with goodies. I baked French cookies from an old recipe and, while hot, twisted them into the shape of fortune cookies. I threaded the insides with ribbon inscribed with love quotes from famous authors. A set of champagne glasses were filled with red candies. Books on best screen kisses and true love stories were essential inclusions. And I designed a custom card, letting them know they were special and worthy of so much love. I delivered the baskets to their front doors, ringing their bells, and presenting with a big hug and well wishes. I became jam-packed with so much love, fun, and joy, more than I had ever experienced on a V-Day date. Unexpectedly, Valentine&#x2019;s Day became my favorite holiday. And by the next year, I had a sweetie who made dinner reservations, donned a red shirt, and showered me with love and presents. Nonetheless, I kept my Cupid act going because I absolutely delighted in showering my sweet friends with beauty and light. Once a friend had a life partner, I cut her loose and added another single lady to my roster.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idf8vddfiha">Now, notice I didn&#x2019;t give in ways I didn&#x2019;t want to. Or out of obligation. Or spend money I didn&#x2019;t have. Or decide to do this when I was already giving so much. I gave in ways that felt enriching to me and others, drawing more good into my life. I made this act of giving a fun and creative adventure that uplifted me even more than the recipients.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ids47l3wvw8">Giving and receiving are one flow. As I give, so do I receive. And when I receive well, I have that much more to give. Plus, giving makes a declarative statement to yourself and the Universe:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idimld3pcm0">I have more than enough. I am enough. I can give because I know I&#x2019;ll always be supported in return.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddkikcn70v">This is an act of embodying your enoughness.</p></section><section data-type="chapter" id="sectidi5j513" class=""><header><h1>Chapter 5: Manifesting Alchemy Principle 5: Making Room for the New</h1></header><h1 class="TitleTtl" id="idu7x6pptg8" data-autolabel="yes" data-labeltext="5">Manifesting Alchemy Principle 5: Making Room for the New</h1><!--A Chapter Number paragraph directly preceding this Chapter Title paragraph was removed during conversion to HTML.

To create a new anything often requires making room so that that new job/lover/trip can come in.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idwy1f0gzdy">There are times when that vacuum is quite literal. I&#x2019;m looking for a television so I donate the old one first. Right after, I find the perfect replacement on sale. Now, I don&#x2019;t usually advise people to quit their jobs before they have found a new one. The one exception is if the workplace is compromising their health. Otherwise, in my experience, it&#x2019;s much easier for people to find new work when they&#x2019;re currently employed and terribly worried about money. But there are times the Universe has other plans. This happened with me.</p><blockquote data-type="epigraph" class=""><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="ida1eyp9cw8">I didn&#x2019;t see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me.

It was a radical change and one that was long overdue. I went from my own office with a window to working from home, using my own computer, and connecting with fellow employees via Skype. This was a high-pressure, high-stress environment, with almost no training, very little planning, and a lot of moving on your feet, with back-to-back product launches and long hours. Any fantasies I had held about working for a company that taught practices I used and believed in were quickly dispelled. Within a week, I thought, <span class="itali">Oh </span><span class="itali">no, what have I done?</span> But all the signs were there that this was the right move. And yet, you take yourself with you wherever you go.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idrmgjzv4so">I decided to heal my way through this job. Anytime I felt mistreated, I healed. Anytime I felt undervalued, I healed. Anytime I was given mind-numbing busywork, I healed. I memorized affirmations and repeated them over and over again while I went through the motions. Then I was given a position within the company I truly aspired to and utilized my best skills. I developed a plan. I had already been a part-time energy healer for years. While employed, I would finally buckle down and develop a business plan, newsletter, and social media presence. I hoped to eventually work for the company part-time and do my healing practice the rest of the time, slowly, eventually building my business until I was fully self-employed. I imagined leaving and them wishing me well, proud of what I had accomplished and grateful for my service. <span class="itali">Insert the sound of a needle scratching a record here</span>. That is <span class="itali">not</span> how it went down.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idp8nu42fcp">A couple of weeks before Christmas, I was let go. It came as an absolute shock. I had been very successful in my new position. How could this have happened? I could hardly move for two days, filled with anger, shame, embarrassment, and despair. What was I going to do now? I cried, I processed, I stayed up late and slept in like a college student. I went for walks. My life-force battery had been sucked dry by this company and its endless drama. I knew I needed to be recharged.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ide27jfm3un">Within a week, I started my newsletter, learning the program more easily than I had imagined. New clients learned of services and contacted me for sessions. Suddenly, with free time on my hands for the first time in eighteen years, I volunteered to share energy healing practices with any group that would have me. The more I shared, the more client sessions I did, the more deeply I fell in love with my work. My business grew.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idr9xmiaxa0">Within two months, I realized I would never work for anyone else ever again. I had had a true epiphany. That day, I had agreed to share EFT, an energy healing technique, with a group of mothers in Dobbs Ferry, New York, about an hour from my home. I woke up early to find a bitterly cold February morning. This was a free gig and would be costing me time, gas, tolls. Why the heck had I agreed to this? But my mood shifted the second I began to drive. Snow had blanketed the landscape for months, and it was one of those hyper-bright sunny days. The brilliant sun sparkled across the ice, inviting new possibility. I instantly connected with the women in the group, giving them a mini workshop with handouts and demos. It was supposed to be an hour, but no one wanted to leave, including me.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idey9z06miy">Afterwards I checked out the downtown, treated myself to a green juice, and headed to nearby Sleepy Hollow for lunch at my favorite Indian restaurant, I was filled with bliss. Before heading home, I visited the waterfronts along the Hudson River, taking pictures of the massive chunks of ice floating there. On the drive back, I had a sudden realization of the date. My former employer was in the middle of another hectic launch. If I had still been employed there, I never would have had this day. I&#x2019;d have logged on, beginning work at 6:30 a.m., answering emails and putting out fires, choking down food on short breaks, logging out at 10:00 p.m., numbing out to TV for a bit, then falling into bed, only to do that over and over again. I knew I&#x2019;d never have to do that again. I felt my heart center open, flooding my body with love and gratitude. My days were now my own to spend as I chose. I could now choose to spend them doing what I loved, connecting with incredible people and sharing a gospel of hope, healing, and happiness.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idv1i38vwtx">A heaviness rapidly left me. I knew that this was exactly how it had to be. I released the anger, neutralized the shame, and forgave my former &#x201C;oppressors.&#x201D; I realized that there are times when your light is so big, it outgrows where you are. Getting brutally honest with myself, I knew that as long as I remained employed there, I would have never had the time, energy, and motivation to build my business. The Universe kicked me out of the nest. I didn&#x2019;t want to be kicked out. This was not my well-laid plan. It hurt! I was quite self-righteous about it. I blamed the foot. I got a bunch of bruises from trying to grasp for stray branches on the way down. I worried what people were saying about me as I was falling. And then, the most unexpected miracle happened: I flew.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idbpeacb4nv">As I&#x2019;m writing this, it&#x2019;s been five and a half years since I was let out of that cage. In that time, I&#x2019;ve traveled to places I&#x2019;ve always wanted to see; spoken in front of hundreds of people, at times ending in standing ovations; taught workshops nationally and internationally; made many new friends; built a successful practice helping thousands of people, along with an outstanding newsletter featuring my original writing and photography; written a book for a very prestigious publisher, recorded its audio, with book number two now sitting in your hands. My time, my energy, my devotion, my focus are all my own. None of this would have happened had I been allowed to remain there.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idx2jccf8k8">I am making it!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idihn1bih7i">During this journey, the funniest thing happened. When I was getting a paycheck, I constantly worried about money, about not having enough, about needing to be employed by others to support myself. Now the Universe is my employer, and I hardly ever worry at all. Money flows in and money flows out. When I need it, it shows up, always right on time, and often in surprising ways. When money flows out to bills, expenses, donations, I bless the recipients and know there&#x2019;s more available. When I need time to write, research, travel, or recharge, business will temporarily dry up, giving me time and energy to do what I most need. Yet my needs are always covered.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id4c1rs7akv">The Universe decided I was ready way before I did. It created a vacuum in my life that was filled with my soul&#x2019;s purpose. In my shock, embarrassment, and fear, I could not have seen that. It was only in processing my feelings and holding that there was good, somehow, some way, in this change, before it was visible or conscious, that I was able to have that perfect day. I was able to recognize that everything I had experienced had happened exactly the way it needed it. That all of it was perfect.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idh1kfmzv81">If you don&#x2019;t create a vacuum, one may be created for you. In my experience, the one you create is always gentler than one that appears to be out of your control.</p><p class="B-HeadBhead" id="idcgtjnftgb"><span class="boldb">Clear </span><span class="boldb">Vacuum Examples</span></p><ol class=""><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idth1ukwmlg">Clothing: If you have a closetful of old, outdated, ill-fitting clothes, donate them.

She held a high-level position in a cutting-edge marketing company. The creativity and innovation inspired her. The competitiveness and backstabbing, even within her own department, not so much. The salary was excellent, but the work travel wasn&#x2019;t enjoyable. She could not figure out how to be happy there. The pros clearly outweighed the cons, but it was getting harder and harder to get out of bed in the morning. Every day, she affirmed happiness and joy, focused on her gratitude, but it still alluded her. She blamed herself. There were so many who would love this job. Why didn&#x2019;t she just toughen up already? Janet was sensitive and bighearted. She couldn&#x2019;t understand why everyone wasn&#x2019;t working together for the good of the projects. It was clear to me; this was simply not the right environment for her. For a certain type of person, the high pressure and competition would invigorate and elevate them. Not for someone like Janet. Feeling targeted and unsafe, her creativity shrank and took her joy with it.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ida6kbqn0ew">Janet could have spent the next ten years imagining this job as the dream job, and it would not have changed. The job was out of alignment with her temperament and needs. She could have kept telling herself, <span class="itali">No, this is it. This is the place for me.

Wrong conditions!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idlwf2f3l3b">When I worked in social services, there came a time with no more growth. No more promotions. No advancement at all. Even though I was hardworking, dedicated, and really effective at my job. Even though I was affirming more money and an upper-management position. I could not figure out why what I wanted wasn&#x2019;t happening. One night, I was rereading an essay by Ralph Waldo Emerson and came across a passage that left me stunned.

Let me be clear, there is no goal too big it can&#x2019;t be achieved. It can just be too big for now. With huge, audacious goals, there&#x2019;s often steps in between, smaller milestones to achieve. No one goes directly from the mail room to CEO. And TMZ is riddled with horror stories of what happens to people who got famous overnight. You&#x2019;ve got some growing and learning to do.

Her creativity came back to life, and she often took her demonstration projects home to finish them. More and more, she looked forward to being with those kids and their wide-eyed wonder, sarcastic jokes, and high energy. It came so naturally. Within a few months, she learned the CEO was retiring and found herself saying, &#x201C;I&#x2019;d love to submit.&#x201D; Her experience in the marketing world was very attractive to the board, who wanted to expand services and needed increased grant funding and visibility. She got the job! And she was terrified! She had never been a CEO or worked in the nonprofit world, yet she couldn&#x2019;t deny it, this just felt right. She lost about 15 percent of her income but gained fifteen to twenty hours more free time per week, time she spent on her own art, which began selling. Within two years, she was making more than she ever had.

If any pictures or symbols come up, throw those in the box too. Now close the lid and visualize handing it over to the Universe. It could look like plopping it in a large set of hands or a giant ball of light, or into something that looks like a star. Breathe in and exhale, letting it go.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id6guiu9sds">Say, &#x201C;I release this over to you, Universe. I&#x2019;m done. Help me retain whatever lessons I needed to learn.

Changing your thinking does indeed change your life. Most of us are caught in endless loops, repeating the same thought patterns over and over again. Have you ever spoken to a good friend about something they just can&#x2019;t seem to let go? Like, for example, their cheating louse of an ex-husband? Once he&#x2019;s entered the topic of conversation, you can almost repeat word for word what your friend is saying. You&#x2019;ve heard it a thousand times before. And here she goes again. It&#x2019;s like there&#x2019;s a recording in her forehead. His name hits the Play button. Often, loops are the narration of experiences where we&#x2019;ve felt let down: by a person, an organization, or by life itself. It was so unfair! Anyplace where you&#x2019;ve felt victimized and not vindicated will show up as blocks to be healed. That healing can take place on the mental level of creation. Or it may require one or more of the other levels.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id911yernul">In addition to practices that work on the mental level of creation, I&#x2019;m going to introduce others that work with emotional, physical, and energetic levels of creation. There are some manifestations, and blocks to achieving them, that benefit from being approached by a different angle. This gives you several options to try, testing what works best for you and what doesn&#x2019;t.</p><p class="B-HeadBhead" id="idm5fv6ymss"><span class="boldb">Temperament</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idikng5ip63">I believe a factor in what practices work and don&#x2019;t work as well can be related to individual temperament. Each of us is born with a personality and a temperament, or a tendency for certain moods. Caregivers of children all know this. And while we are all tremendously shaped by the families, cultures, religions (or no religion), and communities we are born into, there are unchangeable parts of us that arrived at conception. The nature-versus-nurture debate is fascinating. Studies of identical twins separated at birth and raised in very different households showed researchers what they weren&#x2019;t expecting: that children aren&#x2019;t total blank slates after all. I have seen this in my own life. I have changed in so many profound ways over the past thirty years. When I had social anxiety, speaking to a stranger was unthinkable. It was hard enough to talk with people I knew! Now I can chat with my seatmate on a plane or introduce myself to a person at a conference quite easily. Not to forget standing on a stage speaking to hundreds of people! Social anxiety was not my natural temperament but a healable condition. If I had decided I was just shy, I may not have realized this could change. Yet I am still very much an introvert. I have moments of being extroverted, like when I&#x2019;m throwing a raucous Halloween party. The wild reveler is summoned from within me. But on an average night, you won&#x2019;t find me in a large group at a bar. I prefer one-on-one conversations and quiet time for reading, creative projects, and spiritual practices. That&#x2019;s my normal temperament.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id4frgddoqh">You may be a big thinker. If you&#x2019;ve ever spent hours online researching the right rental car company or the history behind the Hindenburg disaster, that may be you.

In many instances, you will have options. If one process isn&#x2019;t arousing your enthusiasm, check out another level practice and feel free to use it instead. It&#x2019;s important to make the manifestation process enjoyable and fun. The more you enjoy these practices, the better you will feel, and the more likely you will be to make them a part of your life. You may begin manifesting with one specific goal in mind, that once achieved, you will put this kind of work aside. That is a valid approach, and regularly integrating these practices into your life will move every aspect forward in the most extraordinary ways.</p><section data-type="chapter" id="sectidmj8y16" class=""><header><h1>Chapter 8: Manifesting Alchemy Practice 1: Affirmations and Scripting</h1></header><h1 class="TitleTtl" id="idtbeh1sz1j" data-autolabel="yes" data-labeltext="8">Manifesting Alchemy Practice 1: Affirmations and Scripting</h1><!--A Chapter Number paragraph directly preceding this Chapter Title paragraph was removed during conversion to HTML.

A talented actor nearing his forties, he was beginning to lose hope that he&#x2019;d ever be able to support himself doing what he loved best. Every audition seemed to go the same. He spent time analyzing and preparing, nervous about doing his best. He would show up early, looking the part, and attempt to please the casting agents. The last dozen auditions ended exactly the same way. He was told he simply missed the mark for what they had in mind. Now these were twelve completely dissimilar projects with different staff. The only thing they had in common was Johan.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2zxk4ngkx">Since he was a person comfortable with scripts, I encouraged him to outline his next audition in advance.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idg6djfstfl">I asked him: What is the best that can happen here?

Ideally, it will be inspired action. That means you forge the path in consciousness first, on the invisible plain that is within your energy field. You get clear, imagine, daydream, foster the feelings, dissolve the blocks, embody the vision, and surrender. Then you get impulses, ideas, inspirations, and motivations to take specific actions. When these arise, act on them, and do so immediately.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idxs28fjx0x">Have you ever looked for a job and sent out dozens of r&#xE9;sum&#xE9;s, only to get almost no response? That is an investment that didn&#x2019;t yield a worthwhile return. Conventional wisdom says to send as many as possible. Cast a wide net. Knock on a thousand doors. There may be times on the journey where you need to persevere. But scattering your energy will not pay off.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idoanzy2cp1">Inspired action is so powerful because you make moves that create results. This saves time, energy, money, and motivation. You get an instinct, a thought, an idea, to visit a particular website, read a specific book, email an old friend or business associate. And that action leads to the next step toward achieving your goal.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idk1mjzlf6e">Here are a few examples from my students:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2bjjgbggk">Carla was consciously creating a divine love relationship. She hadn&#x2019;t dated anyone since her bitter divorce five years before. The divorce had given her a lot of evidence about what she did not want in a long-term mate. She spent time cleaning up the past, and this revealed a new hopefulness about finding love. From that hope, she began to imagine deep conversations, Sunday morning snuggle-fests, and a much-desired trip to New Zealand, ziplining hand in hand with her man. While she was cultivating the thoughts and feelings of true love, she held off on dating apps and actively pursuing potentials at gatherings, despite the urging of her friends. It just didn&#x2019;t feel quite right. Then her high school childhood buddy Steve tracked her down on Facebook. One night, they spoke for hours, catching up on all the highlights and lowlights over the past thirty years. It felt synchronistic that they were back in touch after all these years! Carla mentioned she was thinking of learning to sell real estate, and Steve suggested she contact the agent he had recently hired. Tony not only sold real estate but trained new agents. He might be able to advise her on how to learn the trade and get started. Even though she wasn&#x2019;t sure if she was ready to begin this venture, calling Tony felt like the correct action to take. Normally, Carla wasn&#x2019;t comfortable contacting people she didn&#x2019;t already know, but she found herself calling anyway. From the moment she spoke with him, he seemed familiar, kind, and knowledgeable. She immediately felt at ease. They developed a friendship as he suggested courses to take and pitfalls to be aware of. Within two months, they began dating and married within a year. Everything had fallen, seemingly miraculously, into place.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id04jwk3lni">Calling Tony was inspired action. It wasn&#x2019;t even an action that appeared to be about love. But it was a suggestion that felt easy, comfortable, and right. Carla somehow knew that the man for her wasn&#x2019;t to be found online or in her immediate circle. She waited until an inspired move appeared and acted on it. Her old friend Steve was the conduit. Later, she asked him why he had tracked her down at that time. Steve said he had watched a documentary on roller-skating, and, remembering it was her favorite high school activity, he felt inspired to locate her. So it was actually two inspired actions that brought Carla and Tony together.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idrghpz6ri8">Omar came to my class begrudgingly. His boyfriend, my client Patrick, had gently suggested, then later pushed him to come. Omar absolutely detested his job as an accountant for a prestigious law firm. Patrick simply could no longer tolerate the daily complaining. An ultimatum was drawn. Omar would either take my class or no longer whine about the job. He didn&#x2019;t necessarily believe in this stuff, but he admitted that Patrick&#x2019;s life had changed in huge ways upon becoming a manifestor. Omar learned he did enjoy numbers and budgets; they had always come easily to him. It was the environment that felt crushing. Formal suits, endless meetings, aggressive colleagues, and constant &#x201C;imperative&#x201D; demands, even on weekends. He was too exhausted to even update his r&#xE9;sum&#xE9;, let alone look for another job. And how could he possibly leave the large salary and perks? I advised him to mentally put the job aside for now. To show up, go through the motions, but with a sense of detachment. I helped him release some fears of shutting off the work emails on weekends. Much to his surprise, there weren&#x2019;t any repercussions from his setting boundaries that he couldn&#x2019;t handle. He got clear about what he wanted his ideal work life to look like: fewer hours, an easier commute, a softer and more socially conscious company vibe, colleagues with a sense of humor, and casual attire. He also was certain about how he wanted to feel: valued, respected, relaxed, and jovial. Before my course ended, he got a message on LinkedIn from a former colleague. He had left the law firm in a huff over five years before and Omar was surprised he even remembered him. Rowan was now a lawyer for a large tech firm, and they were looking for an accountant with Omar&#x2019;s qualifications. With a new energy to move forward, he updated his r&#xE9;sum&#xE9; and sent it immediately. The interview took place in a playful loft space with beanbag chairs, a soda fountain, and a foosball table! He was greeted warmly by comfortably dressed employees who shared the company&#x2019;s many benefits, like paid time off for volunteering for a cause of his choice, tropical brainstorming retreats, and an emphasis on proper work-life balance. The CEO had been a member of the same college fraternity. They had instant rapport. He got the job and, with it, a 10 percent bump in salary and fifteen-minute-shorter commute. A year later, impressed with the supportive corporate culture, Patrick joined the team as a graphic designer.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idqfj22mnj4">As long as Omar was exhausted and stuck in negativity, it would have been very difficult to find any new job, let alone the right job. Once he set boundaries, cleared fear, and created a vision for what could be, a divine opportunity presented itself, and he was then prepared to act on it.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idpq2et2224">In these two previous examples, the Universe worked through people my students had previously known, who provided outlets for manifestation. Here&#x2019;s a different example of inspired action.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idv51emzukd">Kelly had been a talented painter since childhood. Her mother always bragged, &#x201C;You drew before you walked!&#x201D; After having her third child, balancing motherhood with her full-time job meant putting art aside, for a year or two, or such was the plan. Now thirteen years had gone by since she&#x2019;d picked up a brush. She wanted to begin again, but each time she sat down at her easel, she felt rusty and uninspired. When starting to manifest, her dream was to have her work hang in a gallery. After forgiving herself for such a long creative absence, she knew she wanted to feel inspired, passionate, and filled with a zest for life. One of her friends mentioned attending a brilliant off-Broadway musical based on the artist Van Gogh. It didn&#x2019;t catch Kelly&#x2019;s attention. Then another friend had returned from a trip to Holland and regaled her with how moved she had been by the Van Gogh Museum. <span class="itali">Eh,</span> Kelly thought. She had never been a fan. Her middle child spoke of learning about the artist in school. Still, nothing. Then while browsing her favorite bookstore, she felt drawn to a calendar featuring Van Gogh&#x2019;s works. It being February, the calendar was 75 percent off. She told herself her son might enjoy the pictures. Two nights after purchasing it, she woke up in the middle of the night and could not get back to sleep. She found herself browsing through the calendar. It was like she was seeing his works for the first time. Pulling out a sketch pad, she began to draw with a sweeping flow she hadn&#x2019;t experienced before. By morning, she was painting, and in a unique style that captivated her. Two years later, she had her very first gallery showing.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idl2whrsnxj">Kelly kept getting signs that an artist long gone was the key to finding new innovative flow. Due to Van Gogh&#x2019;s popularity and her previous exposure to his work, she had dismissed the hints that kept presenting themselves to her until inspired action drew her to the calendar that opened everything for her.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idqgyerfwge">This brings me to signs. The Universe was speaking to Kelly, offering a much-needed solution that would get her started in her goals. Based on old ideas, she just wasn&#x2019;t getting them, until she did. This demonstrates both the Universe&#x2019;s unlimited patience with us and its endless methods for giving us answers.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id4d6h5i4xj">It&#x2019;s easier to spot an inspired action assignment when we&#x2019;ve learned to ask for, recognize, and/or properly interrupt signs. As a meme I once came across said, &#x201C;There are some questions that can&#x2019;t be answered by Google.&#x201D; Our human knowledge is limited. We can&#x2019;t possibly see the myriad of possibilities and puzzle pieces that can come together to form a miraculous manifestation. But the Universe does indeed know. Accessing this wisdom is imperative to manifesting both joyously and efficiently.</p><blockquote data-type="epigraph" class=""><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="ids56gvaknr">Nothing gets in the way of love.

At the time, things were dire. She was living out of her car, unable to afford an apartment, trying to make it in comedy. Kevin gave her $300 for a hotel room. He told her to make a list of what she wanted to do in her career. With nothing left to lose, she made the list. After that, immediately her circumstances began to change. She got a call about a very cheap apartment that was just what she was able to afford. Opportunities began opening up. And now she&#x2019;s an actor in major movies and featured in her own comedy specials. She accomplished everything on that list, including becoming friends with Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith, and much more!</p><p class="Num-Level-1-List-ParagraphNl1p" id="idd8p6varbd">On January 5, 2018, my birthday, I quickly created a list of what I wanted to accomplish that year. &#x201C;Write a book&#x201D; was included. I had wanted to do just that since I was eight and first fell in love with the written word. I could express on paper what I was unable to say out loud. Yet in all these years I had not done it. Recent developments in the world of self-publishing that had streamlined the process felt promising for me. But at the time I made the list, this goal seemed unlikely. I was in a new living space, traveling, and expanding my healing business. When would I find the time to write a book? And on what? I could easily write on a hundred topics, but nothing seemed to be on the top of the list. I just couldn&#x2019;t narrow it down. Less than two months later, I was asked by St. Martin&#x2019;s Essentials to write a book on energy healing. No book proposal, no agent, no outline. And this is a topic I don&#x2019;t just know but live. I wrote it in six weeks. My schedule suddenly cleared, giving me the space I needed to get it done. A year later, I was a legimate author, with a most well respected and prestigious publisher. One of my favorite things to do when I travel is visit bookstores and find my book on a shelf. Signing it makes me incredibly happy! The Universe had a bigger idea for me than I had for myself. When I was speaking with a literary agent and shared my publishing story, he kept saying, &#x201C;This is highly unusual. Most unlikely! I can&#x2019;t believe this is how you got a book deal.

I found it valuable to explore ancient spirituality that likely existed thousands of years before the birth of religions. Native people from all over the world, who were unable to communicate with one another in any known manner, often cultivated and utilized extremely similar spiritual and healing principles and practices. This was very intriguing to me. How is that people separated by great distances &#x201C;somehow&#x201D; created similar beliefs? I believe that we are all connected and influenced by energy itself and and inner knowing. When I see a manifestation process being taught in similar fashions by different teachers and schools of thought, I take notice. That&#x2019;s because spiritual truths are spiritual truths, whether they were practiced in a ritual circa 3000 <span class="smallcapssc">BC </span>or on a recent law of attraction cruise.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idayqn0xgzl">One practice I&#x2019;ve seen in various forms is based on tracking thoughts. You actively uncover and get conscious about what exactly you&#x2019;re thinking.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ideqc7xlqum">When I originally did this exercise, I was horrified by what I was focused on much of the time. One major revelation was how incredibly defensive my mind was. I was often mentally arguing with and defending myself against what I perceived as betrayals or insults from others. Sometimes, these offenses hadn&#x2019;t even occurred! For example, I had been ill and skipped a work meeting, only to imagine that not everyone present knew the real reason I wasn&#x2019;t there. They&#x2019;d be talking about me in the lunch room, assuming I&#x2019;d blown it off and that I didn&#x2019;t have to follow the rules. I found myself mentally guarding my honor. I conducted this defense while doing the dishes!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idxd9jzqzi3">More often than not, these situations never even came to pass. Yet in my mind, I was Xena, warrior princess, sword in hand, rattling a battle cry to protect myself at all costs! This realization alone changed my life. When I was in these mental ramblings, I felt anxious, angry, wounded, and utterly exhausted. I got very honest with myself, tracking the origin of the pattern, healing wounds where I had felt victimized, blamed, bullied, and criticized. It required great effort but I knew my freedom was on the other side of forgiving all those I believe wronged me. And I did just that. I learned to cultivate a trust in the Universe and in life. When my mental defense trials relaxed, an interesting development occurred. I was able to stand up for myself in a way I never had, not alone in my head, but in my actual relationships. For all my mental bluster, I was actually terrible at following through in real-life situations where I felt shamed or hurt. Now I could say everything I had always needed to express. And my inner Xena took a back seat to a newly channeled Diane Lockhart from <span class="itali">The Good Wife.</span> Confident, calm, composed, whip smart, and tremendously effective. I set healthy boundaries and insisted that I was treated with the same respect I gave others. The more I did this, the easier it became. Then a funny thing happened. Eventually, I hardly had to do this at all. The people in my life either complied or peacefully moved on. Those who left were replaced with gentler folks who respected themselves and, thus, me. Once I cultivated my inner peace, my relationships shifted as they no longer needed to reflect back to me painful past experiences. When the war in my mind ended, so did much of my conflicts with others.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1gxjv8xsd">I sometimes offer this exercise to clients, but not all are interested. Chloe was an unusual exception. An experienced triathlete, she was comfortable setting goals and embracing challenges. She had done years of personal growth work and didn&#x2019;t expect to uncover anything she wasn&#x2019;t already aware of. Not having what she wanted in romantic relationships had led her to me. What happened when she did this process came as a complete shock to her. She discovered how often she focused on &#x201C;what she should have said.&#x201D; As a fellow writer, she held the power to edit, reword, explore, and even start all over again with her work. This just didn&#x2019;t translate in verbal conversations with others. Outside of her career, she felt slow in social situations, often struggling to express herself with the &#x201C;right&#x201D; words. Many interactions left her reliving them over and over again, mentally editing not only the use of words but her tone of voice and actions. Some of these &#x201C;new-and-improved&#x201D; conversations ended up in her stories. Her mind had compiled a catalog of every memory where she believed she&#x2019;d slipped up, misrepresented herself, or bungled an opportunity for more meaningful connection. Several went back months or even years! She often relived them over and over again so habitually that she had no idea she was doing it. The memories brought up feelings of embarrassment and irritation, but her mind was insistent on &#x201C;fixing&#x201D; these until she got them right. Having always thought of herself as confident and an excellent communicator, it was painful to realize these thoughts went against fundamental beliefs she held in herself. But within the realization came the opportunity for real transformation. This pattern held an underlying belief that she was awkward and shy, a leftover from a short-lived childhood bullying situation. As she healed these thoughts, all her relationships changed. Now more relaxed and at ease, she not only could express herself more effectively, she was able to leave the conversations behind once over. Then she met her soon-to-be husband.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id6jzc1tguj">I&#x2019;ve found the following exercise so valuable; I repeat it each year.</p><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="idaonvwzq84"><span class="boldb">Minding Your Monkey Mind</span></p><ol class=""><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="id4ubftdjfz">Set aside a minimum of a week to do this, two if you&#x2019;re able.</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idah7uwlcz4">Before beginning:</p><ol class="level2list"><li class="Alpha-Level-2-ListAl2"><p class="Alpha-Level-2-ListAl2" id="iduan0dowja">Look at your schedule and identify areas of routine.

Something really fantastic has happened for you. And now everything is going your way! There&#x2019;s a perfect parking spot just waiting for you. A shopper opens a door the moment you arrive and gallantly holds it. You&#x2019;re humming and smiling! &#x201C;Doesn&#x2019;t everything look marvelous today?&#x201D; You beam. An unexpected check arrives in the mail. All the colors of sky look extra-rich. And everyone around you is responding positively to those sweet high vibes you&#x2019;re blasting.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1amus2ln7">There&#x2019;s a scene from the movie <span class="itali">500 Days of Summer</span> that beautifully illustrates this effect. Tom, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, wins the heart of the girl of his dreams, Summer, as played by Zooey Deschanel. After their first night together, he leaves her apartment smiling, as the Hall and Oates song &#x201C;You Make My Dreams (Come True)&#x201D; begins to play. The sun is shining on his face, and everyone he passes is greeting him with a smile and a hello. The fountain he walks past delightfully shoots water as if in celebration of his happiness. Grinning at his reflection in a window, each passersby joins him in a joyous dance routine. A simple walk to work made magical just by the way he was feeling.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ides495bqen">I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;ve also had the opposite experience. You and your partner argued the night before. Tossing and turning all night long, you wake from a bad dream. Grumbling, you step on the toothpaste, and it shoots out onto the bathroom floor, that your dog has now walked in and is leaving a trail of it down the hallway and onto your new rug. You&#x2019;re already late for work, and the elevator door shuts just as you get to it. The boss blasts you for a mistake you didn&#x2019;t even make. In this scenario, the world around you is also responding to the vibes you&#x2019;re putting out. It&#x2019;s always doing that! But this time you&#x2019;re emanating a low vibration.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idjzzo9qjwf">When I worked in a traditional office, my fellow colleagues would advise me to stay away from the copiers when I was in a foul mood.

Just my energy alone would do them in.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idruuqkt1qi">You don&#x2019;t have to wait until your next great love or stellar promotion comes along to consciously create these vibrations.

Period. If nothing else ever came of it, the practice itself would be worth doing. And time and time again, I&#x2019;ve seen this little attitude adjustment yield fantastic results. While you&#x2019;re &#x201C;performing,&#x201D; that twitterpating effect is inviting similar feeling tones and experiences into your life, making you very attractive to new people and opportunities. After all, would you give the promotion to the copy machine breaker? Haven&#x2019;t you tried avoiding people who are just like that? All day, every day, we are automatically energetically interacting with everyone we are in contact with, including the person sitting next to you on the train that you have never spoken with. Raising positive feelings sends signals out to others that you sure are nice to be around. And your energy is interacting with the energy of All That Is, inviting similar vibrations to be returned to you. Plus, you will likely take actions that return even more good to you.</p></section><section data-type="chapter" id="sectid8srn22" class=""><header><h1>Chapter 14: Manifesting Alchemy Practice 7: Dancing Your Dreams</h1></header><h1 class="TitleTtl" id="id62x3usac9" data-autolabel="yes" data-labeltext="14">Manifesting Alchemy Practice 7: Dancing Your Dreams</h1><!--A Chapter Number paragraph directly preceding this Chapter Title paragraph was removed during conversion to HTML.

Nearly one-third will file for bankruptcy within three to five years of winning. I once watched a documentary called <span class="itali">Reversal of Fortune.</span> A homeless man was given $100,000 if he agreed to be filmed. He was allowed to spend the money however he wished. Knowing how consciousness works, it was easy, and incredibly sad, to predict the outcome. The film producers connected him with a financial adviser and offered guidance, monitoring his progress. Yet within a short period of time, the money was gone. Radical changes can feel like a threat to the body, especially the nervous system. And yes, this includes the best changes! When a blessing unfolds, it can pull us out of our comfort zones. Normal everyday life feels safe. For this gentleman, collecting recycling for money each day made him happy. As much as the money seemed like the greatest gift, his consciousness was not prepared for such a windfall. This is also a perfect example of how changing circumstances from the outside without the inner work preceding it can lead to short-lived and frustrating results.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idu2o6k1o33">Besides Acting as If, the &#x201C;Dancing Your Dreams&#x201D; exercise prepares the body for manifestations. You&#x2019;re essentially practicing as if you already have achieved it, without any pressures that may come along with the reality. What pressures would those be, pray tell? If you&#x2019;ve attracted a new love, pressure can surface from a number of areas. Meeting this person&#x2019;s family and/or children. How to navigate the first fight. The fear of it not working out. Traveling together. For a financial windfall, there&#x2019;s the pressure of how to spend it wisely. Or how to handle people asking you for money. To donate or not donate? If so, how much? Then there&#x2019;s learning the computer system in your new Tesla. That&#x2019;s quite a bit to manage. When practicing, it&#x2019;s all fun and all joy. Be playful and enjoy the process.</p><p class="B-HeadBhead" id="idosshy0eqb"><span class="boldb">Dancing Your Dreams</span></p><ol class=""><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idni1o5l2ts">1.

There are those that do short lists, just a few bullet points. I&#x2019;m a writer, so bullet points aren&#x2019;t my style. Too brief! Too cold! I could wax philosophical about the way the sun beams are hitting my curtains for days!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1z04qu1m2">I have found what makes gratitude journals magical is when what has been written creates warm feelings. It&#x2019;s one thing to think, <span class="itali">Ye</span><span class="itali">a</span><span class="itali">h, I</span><span class="itali">&#x2019;</span><span class="itali">m grateful for my good health.</span> It&#x2019;s another thing entirely to remember how easily you bounded up those steps earlier without breaking a sweat and how strong and powerful you felt shoveling snow. Or maybe you were so busy checking off your mental to-do list that that moment had passed you by. Why not revisit this? What does gratitude for good health feel like? Those are the feelings that will further encourage you to keep taking good care of your physical well-being.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idf82snhgfq">So, yes, a sincere, feelings-based gratitude journal is always a good idea. More to follow on that.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id4qqltjugn">And I&#x2019;d like you to keep track of something else, something pivotal in being a master manifestor.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idrsbse71s5">Document your manifestations. Your blessings. Your miracles. Call it whatever feels right for you.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idktc8xzwgm">It can be shocking how easily we forget after we&#x2019;ve created something wonderous. Especially if you&#x2019;ve healed a physical pain, a broken relationship, or a depleted bank account. Once the pain is past, the trouble behind you, it can be like there had never been anything wrong in the first place. Yes, by all means, revel in that success! Don&#x2019;t let it slip past uncelebrated. Track that story with all it&#x2019;s gorgeous detail. Write. It. Down!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idrp00xi6ll">All along, we have talked about working with our conscious minds, that doubting Thomas in our heads that&#x2019;s pretty much convinced us all of this could just be plain nonsense. We ignore our conscious minds with their nagging doubts at our own peril. Better to subdue that monkey mind with specific real-life evidence. Especially if the manifestation in question feels very much otherworldly. Try your hand at explaining the unexplainable.

I really needed gas money and started to panic. First, I used journaling to calm the panic. Then I imagined I was driving on a short road trip. The weather was gorgeous, window open, breeze whipping through my hair. I stopped for gas and easily filled up. I also prayed, knowing I was safe, and all would be well. I felt a great sense of calm and trust come over me. Then four days later, I got a check in the mail from my car insurance company. They had been overcharging me and, realizing the mistake, were refunding me $327.00! I remember holding that check in my hand and just starting to cry with relief. I felt electricity running up and down my spine, like when I hear a favorite song. It was like I was cocooned with love and care from the Universe. I was able to get gas and groceries and pay an outstanding bill. At the grocery store, I treated myself to my favorite olives. My friend Jane said she&#x2019;s never heard of an insurance company admitting a mistake. I told her it was a miracle, and as I said it, I knew it was.&#x201D;</p><p class="Numbered-ParagraphNp" id="id0tu2ahxcd">&#x2014;MJ</p><p class="Numbered-ParagraphNp" id="idvtpwnn1r5">2. &#x201C;My car was on its last wheels. It kept failing inspection, and my mechanic said it would be more than the car was worth to fix it. I created a list of all the qualities I wanted in a car, emphasizing affordability. My brother called out of the blue. He asked, &#x2018;Do you need a new car?&#x2019; His new next-door neighbor was a repo man who was sometimes left with cars he needed homes for. I met him the next day, and he had the perfect one for me, only charging me $500 over what was owed on the loan, which was small. The only problem with it was the inside was very dirty and smelled like rotten eggs. My brother offered to have it detailed. When I picked it up, it looked (and smelled) like brand new.&#x201D;</p><p class="Numbered-ParagraphNp" id="idwo3tcftqy">&#x2014;CS</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idd3n6vlnbw">These examples may seem significant.

You can only start where you are. Acceptance of what is, is the very first step in changing it. Once you&#x2019;ve stopped avoiding and gotten really clear about your current circumstances, relief awaits you on the other side.</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idbqkbuat5k">2. No matter how good life gets, there will always be at least one area that could use healing, improvement, or radical change. Give up on the notion of perfection. Our souls are perfect, whole, and complete, no matter what. Our human experience? Not so much! Energy is always in a state of expansion and contraction, so our only consistency is change. That can make for messiness. When everything feels just so right, I can guarantee another change is coming. Knowing this can be very freeing. You&#x2019;ll never be done be done creating your ideal life and your ideal life can and will change.</p></li></ol><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idw7apyzo91">Let&#x2019;s talk about my old friend frustration. If your life circumstances don&#x2019;t look the way you&#x2019;d like, and that&#x2019;s highly possible if you&#x2019;re reading this book, then you may know this feeling well. You may have tried to change your life in the past and not made substantial progress. It may have left you feeling like you&#x2019;re pushing against the current of life, only to be dragged further out to sea, defeated and confused.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1447qex3m">How would I know? True confession time. Hi, my name is Kris, and I am a frustration-aholic.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id5z88t6nkp">Start with an easily frustrated temperament, add a take-charge personality, mix in a whole lot of stubbornness, while being an advanced student from the School of Hard Knocks, and here you have me. Why I also developed such high expectations for myself and life, I do not know, but it has certainly added to it!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idfxpa5vquz">How I healed this was by regularly practicing acceptance of what is. It&#x2019;s a concept shared by many spiritual disciplines. There&#x2019;s that popular cultural mantra of &#x201C;It is what it is.&#x201D; When the words accompany an actual authentic feeling of acceptance, that alone can help move you into peace. On the other hand, if you say or think this while feeling resigned or angry, it won&#x2019;t do a thing. Feeling discouraged, halted, and sometimes enraged had not changed a single thing in my life. It simply made me more and more frustrated. I became the mythical Sisyphus, forever pushing the boulder up the mountain, only to have it roll back down to the bottom. I learned that facing the truth, exactly as it was, allowed my manifesting efforts to move forward. Once the current reality was no longer being resisted, change was now possible.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id4l6a82vs6">No matter who you are or what your life is like now, there is good to be acknowledged and savored. I know that because you have this book. Either you purchased it, borrowed it from a library or friend, were given it as a gift, or found it. You hold in your hands information. And if you have this information, you likely are able to read or view other important information. Once you make peace with what is, it&#x2019;s easy to realize just how much good you already have.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idiowl1loaz">And if you&#x2019;re experiencing any resistance to what is, I recommend doing one of these processes before moving forward. You can return to them anytime &#x201C;what is&#x201D; feels maddening or unbearable.</p><aside data-type="sidebar" class="box"><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="idtsuysu4kr"><span class="boldb">Manifesting Mini Process: Practices to Accept What Is</span></p><p class="B-HeadBhead" id="idmpd1ywapg"><span class="boldb">Affirmations</span></p><ul class=""><li class="Unnum-Level-1-ListUl1"><p class="Unnum-Level-1-ListUl1" id="ids4sftt3cf">I deeply and completely love and accept myself, exactly as I am right now and as I change and grow.</p></li><li class="Unnum-Level-1-ListUl1"><p class="Unnum-Level-1-ListUl1" id="iddowsxx9n2">I accept my life as it is right now, and it is changing for the better each and every day.</p></li><li class="Unnum-Level-1-ListUl1"><p class="Unnum-Level-1-ListUl1" id="id43gmhr9w7">I am worthy of my own approval, and I accept myself now.</p></li><li class="Unnum-Level-1-ListUl1"><p class="Unnum-Level-1-ListUl1" id="id9qjjjktzx">I appreciate all the good in myself and love that it grows.</p></li><li class="Unnum-Level-1-ListUl1"><p class="Unnum-Level-1-ListUl1" id="idsfgzd03yq">I see all the good in my life and know I am blessed in every way.</p></li><li class="Unnum-Level-1-ListUl1"><p class="Unnum-Level-1-ListUl1" id="id5b7un0po2">My life is very good now and getting better and better every day.</p></li><li class="Unnum-Level-1-ListUl1"><p class="Unnum-Level-1-ListUl1" id="id667fiqn4v">I forgive myself and embrace all that I am.</p></li></ul></aside><p class="SeparatorSep" id="id7yb3guffy">[Separator]</p><aside data-type="sidebar" class="box"><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="idsrf0uya9m"><span class="boldb">Manifesting Mini Process: </span><span class="boldb">Guided Meditation</span></p><ol class=""><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="id7oehampgt">Get into a comfortable position.</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idgmi9mesdu">Close your eyes and begin to focus on your breath as you breathe normally.</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="id4ieeltr82">After a minute or so, deepen your breathing in a way that is still comfortable.</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idpedd5jx8v">Imagine you are breathing in and out through the center of your chest.

When you look at the lives of megawatt manifestors, there&#x2019;s a reason they were people who lived lives of constant spiritual study, practice, with endless devotion. It likely requires just that! Megawatters lived in quiet isolation in monasteries or ashrams, where their only job title was: Lover of God. These masters didn&#x2019;t have careers where they fretted over loss in their 401(k) or whether their company would survive a recession. They didn&#x2019;t have a spouse complaining about noisy neighbors and a much-needed kitchen overhaul. And they certainly weren&#x2019;t changing dirty diapers, getting help for a child&#x2019;s learning disabilities, or researching colleges.

Mission accomplished.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idp2lzzetgf">Most often, you will need to take outward action, sometimes more, sometimes less. In the beginning, it&#x2019;s often more action. After creating with consistency and diligence, there will be a time when you realize you&#x2019;re achieving more and more Level 4s. You will simply think of something, and it will show up in your experience. Know that all beginning efforts are not just fueling your immediate target but creating a cumulative effect for future endeavors. Your confidence in yourself and the Universe grows. Your beliefs in possibilities expand. Along the way, you&#x2019;ve been clearing out old narratives about yourself and the way life works or didn&#x2019;t. Now every area of life starts working more easily.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idxqjjog2nv">A few years ago, I was cleaning my then house when a single thought came to mind. <span class="itali">I</span><span class="itali">&#x2019;</span><span class="itali">d like a cat that looks like a cheetah.</span> It passed in and out of my head. Now, I wasn&#x2019;t in the market for a new cat. Not at all. As I spent time being conscious of my thoughts, in meditation and contemplation, this seemed like just another random one, not connected to anything important. I literally didn&#x2019;t give it a second thought. Then a week later, on a brutal, rainy night in late October, I heard a high-pitched, panicked cry coming from outside and directed towards my front door. When I investigated, a tiny, malnourished kitten popped out of my drenched hedges and ran toward the door and into my arms. Meer skin and bones, I knew there was no way she would make it through this bitter night. I brought her onto my porch and got a towel to dry her off. It was only then that I noticed she had spots on her side, like a mini cheetah. In addition, she came bearing a deformed front leg. My logical mind went into overdrive. <span class="itali">I don</span><span class="itali">&#x2019;</span><span class="itali">t want another cat.</span> (But I kind of did.) <span class="itali">She</span><span class="itali">&#x2019;</span><span class="itali">s got special needs and is going to require so much vete</span><span class="itali">ri</span><span class="itali">nary care.</span> (She doesn&#x2019;t and didn&#x2019;t.) <span class="itali">My partner won</span><span class="itali">&#x2019;</span><span class="itali">t want her.</span> (He didn&#x2019;t. Initially. But then she outlasted him!) <span class="itali">My other cat won</span><span class="itali">&#x2019;</span><span class="itali">t accept her.</span> (She did. Wholeheartedly.) <span class="itali">This isn</span><span class="itali">&#x2019;</span><span class="itali">t going to work!</span> (Fast-forward to the happy ending: it did.) As much as I tried to talk myself out of the blessing, it was clear. She was <span class="itali">meant </span>to be with me. Her name: the Baby Cheetah. It had all been given to me in that single thought. Nicknames: the Cheet-Machine, Cheetah Rivera, and Queen Bossy Pants. Her leg didn&#x2019;t need to be amputated. It&#x2019;s used for catching sparkly pom-poms and knocking around fake mice. She moves with speed like her namesake and glows with good health. Her stubborn confidence is a constant reminder to me: we are all good enough exactly as we are. She doesn&#x2019;t think there&#x2019;s anything wrong with her, and she&#x2019;s absolutely right. Every day, she makes me laugh. Seven years later, she is one of the loves of my life.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idnmifpad2o">So did a single thought bring a spotted kitten to my door? Was she a Level 4 manifestation? Or was the thought a Universal download, a message, a hearkening of her arrival, a divine adoption request from on high? I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s an either-or pondering. The thought was clearly in my first-person voice&#x2014;<span class="itali">I</span><span class="itali">&#x2019;</span><span class="itali">d like a cat</span>&#x2014;and yet, when she popped up, it felt otherworldly. It was like the thought of her came from a deeper place than where my normal thinking resides. She wasn&#x2019;t a conscious request. It wasn&#x2019;t that I was playing with my other cat and thought, <span class="itali">Oh, this black one, her fur is so boring. I</span><span class="itali">&#x2019;</span><span class="itali">d prefer one in a nice jungle print.</span> Yet the Baby Cheetah clearly has filled a need I didn&#x2019;t know I had. The thought met a need, in this case an unconscious one, which met a dream resonating within me. A dream of more connection and unconditional love. Manifestation occurred. I didn&#x2019;t even contemplate that that dream would be filled by a tiny, seemingly compromised little fur baby. I do know as soon as I saw her sweet spots, that solo thought came back, reverberating chills throughout my entire body. I promise it wasn&#x2019;t just because I was damp from the cold rain. There was an immediate resonance, a full-bodied knowing. I&#x2019;ve learned to listen to those. Deliberately creating develops thinking beyond the left, conscious brain. It enhances an energetic knowing, our intuition, that exists beyond logic and often defies it. I had every cause not to take her in, so many sensible, practical reasons for saying no. But my energy field said yes.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idi7bxo8v6l">Trust what falls in your lap.

I would say loving money over the Universe is always a mistake. Money is just an outlet for spiritual energy. Above all else, love the source of creation over the creations themselves.

Everything that exists or will ever exist comes from one infinite, unlimited source, and that source is a spiritual source. So money is automatically included. You can take the same amount of money and choose to fund political spammers or an orphanage in India. The money is a form of neutral, spiritual energy. If you&#x2019;re a good-hearted, loving person, you&#x2019;ll likely do good and loving acts with money.

No matter how small the amount, it could do good somewhere. Let go of the outcome and just give. See what happens. Did that 1 percent break you? Did you even notice it was gone?

Those percentages will likely fluctuate. And what&#x2019;s key here is to give always with freedom and joy.

It&#x2019;s actually fun for me. Giving doesn&#x2019;t have to be drudgery. In fact, I believe the feelings you have when sharing your talents are just as important as the act itself. Find what you&#x2019;re good at, and be willing to share these gifts you&#x2019;ve been blessed with. Share with enthusiasm and joy!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idow2w8u0m5">See next chapter for Manifesting Reflection Questions on Talents and Skills</p><p class="B-HeadBhead" id="idnjziuo3c0"><span class="boldb">Get Excellent at Receiving</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idoi7yb9nhc">I started out telling you to give and receive in equal measure.

She didn&#x2019;t want you to be cold. She spent money purchasing and shipping it to you because she thought you&#x2019;d truly enjoy it. Thank her enthusiastically.

It&#x2019;s like they&#x2019;ve become disposable currency! Money is not garbage. If I focus even just a bit on them, I will notice them everywhere. But a penny is a unit of energy that when combined with other units can have an impact like any other denomination. When I pick them up, I always say, &#x201C;Thank you, Universe, for this abundance.&#x201D; I encourage you to do the same.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id3q637pbf3">Abundance is not just cash. Nature overflows with abundance everywhere you look. Most plants produce far more seeds than can ever be rooted. Nature has designed it so florae simply overflows with them.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ideuqjokzdi">Spend time in nature observing its abundance. See the multiples of blades of grass. Notice the plethora of weeds! Rather than curse them, bless them! You pull them and they just produce more. Open up a pomegranate, and as you pull the tasty little nuggets out, see the generous abundance inside.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idbkpuxkzgf">The tree doesn&#x2019;t worry its leaves will be too sparse this season. The bird doesn&#x2019;t panic over the source of its next meal. Nature trusts. Nature is flexible. Nature moves with change. When rivers dry up, animals migrate to new waters. Nature is a precise teacher on how the abundance of the Universe works.</p><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="id9rj6iozr9"><span class="boldb">Manifesting Mini Process: Meditate with Rhythms of Nature&#x2019;s Abundance</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idb63qs626f">Allow yourself to get comfortable and begin to follow the easy in-and-out flow of the breath.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idl062emw87">See an empty meadow.

You look ahead, and the meadow is being filled with the lush growth of thousands of beautiful wildflowers in every color, springing up everywhere you look. Breathe the energy of this abundance into your body, reminding you that you are an essential part of nature and abundance is yours now.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idma2zdr8o2">Allow abundance and prosperity to be your natural birthright.

As soon as I could crawl, I went after the magazines on the coffee table, pulling them onto the floor. My mother shared how I would look intently at the pictures as I paged through them, like they were somehow familiar to me. As a child of the &#x2019;70s, I&#x2019;m sure I was curious about the fashion of the time. &#x201C;So this is what people are wearing now? Oh no!&#x201D; When I was eleven, I began subscribing to music magazines like <span class="itali">Rolling Stone,</span> impatiently awaiting each issue so I could read it cover to cover. Later in adulthood, I had magazines coming in the mail constantly. I don&#x2019;t think anyone was more devastated about the loss of print media than I was (and am). Then I began the newsletter for my business. An essential part of being both a healer and small-business owner, newsletters are usually perfunctory affairs of announcements with tidbits of useful content. Not so for me. I turned the newsletter format inside out. By including music videos, poetry, film reviews, original photography, contests, downloadable handouts, and memes, along with articles on healing and class announcements, my newsletter became a passion project.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id24hd7as95">One New Year&#x2019;s Eve, I was torn between three social opportunities: a party, a Buddhist meditation, and a live music event. Normally very decisive, I could not understand why I didn&#x2019;t just pick one and commit already. I was being presented with an option for every possible mood. Then I realized something surprising. What I most wanted to do was stay home and create a newsletter for my then tiny tribe of subscribers. That&#x2019;s exactly what I did. This was my magazine, after all, in which I was editor, photographer, writer, and designer. I would not have wanted to be anywhere or doing anything else. As I got busy, I caught a glance at myself in the mirror, sitting in my underwear, hair in a sloppy bun, and chuckled at the thought of my so-called glamorous life. I rang in the new year filled with creative enthusiasm, doing what I love. Doing what I&#x2019;ve been drawn to since I was a baby!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idythbszjq4">I want you to spend your time doing that which you love so much, you&#x2019;d do it alone. On New Year&#x2019;s Eve. In your underwear.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idpsx2fu7b7">I never actually set out to give my magazine obsession new life in my business. I began the process, learning the technology of the newsletter program, normally not one of my gifts, and within minutes, I was crafting my first edition. As I filled in the necessary blanks, ideas began popping up. <span class="itali">What if I hand</span><span class="itali">-</span><span class="itali">painted a </span><span class="itali">worksheet</span><span class="itali"> </span><span class="itali">on gratitude, attached a scanned copy, and everyone could print it out at home? What if every year on my birthday, I gave away </span><span class="itali">ten</span><span class="itali"> </span><span class="itali">copies of my favorite books? What if I shared my own photos instead of stock </span><span class="itali">images?</span> Each idea felt like a spark. It unfolded organically. When colleagues ask me how I get my ideas, I say, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s so easy. I just love creating my newsletter. The ideas simply just arrive and right on time.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idquoru4r7v">Whenever I sat down to craft the next edition, I noticed that several hours passed in an instant. That still happens. Every. Single. Time.</p><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="id3df1greae"><span class="boldb">Concentration Without Effort</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idr9xulypd4">If you&#x2019;re not clear about what you&#x2019;re truly passionate about, here&#x2019;s a major clue:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1z128tlz7">You experience concentration without effort.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idxh63aym3p">You and your passion lock into a zone of timelessness, and the concentration simply unfolds. It&#x2019;s not laborious or painful. No forcing. No looking at the clock. Hours pass effortlessly.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idg14hpnzot">This is normally where a student will chime in with, &#x201C;Okay, so I love to knit. I could do it for days. But there&#x2019;s no way I can make a living at that! Is that what you&#x2019;re asking us to do? To try to support myself with <span class="itali">knitting</span>?&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9isjmh2vy">I decided to give money its own chapter for a reason. For many of us, our careers will be our main sources of financial abundance. But not always. Money can be manifested in the most extraordinary of ways. The kind of ways that seem like a movie plot rather than real life. Major inheritances, lottery and other contest wins, a significant offer for a creative project. Be open. Manifest the money, and your time is your own to do with as you please. Don&#x2019;t make your passions about money. Money enables you to live. Passions give you a life.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idqnorxb88d">And by the way, yes, you can make a living at knitting. Or baking cupcakes. Or writing movie scripts. As many passions exist in the world, so too are the ways to monetize them. I once met a woman who was passionate about creating the perfect eyebrows. Yes, eyebrows! She created a successful six-figure business, visiting salons within a forty-mile radius of her home, shaping the eyebrows of women of all ages. The salons made the appointments and collected the money. She showed up on her specific day, worked her artistry, and got paid. Once, she showed me illustrations from her high school art classes. Oh, so many eyebrows! The teachers could not understand it. She didn&#x2019;t understand it. But it became her dream career. Later, she added the training of other &#x201C;eyebrow artists&#x201D; to her business model. Surely, if eyebrows can make a person happy and bring home the bacon, then anything can!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idu8x44hk2l">Let&#x2019;s call our doubting knitter Maria. She simply puts her love and effort into her knitting projects. Her friends don&#x2019;t get it. Isn&#x2019;t she bored? Don&#x2019;t her fingers hurt? Ignoring them, she continues with her projects. Then, somehow, Maria gets an idea for a new stitch. It works! She starts classes teaching this to others. To promote the classes, Maria creates funny teaser YouTube videos on topics like choosing eye-catching yarn color combinations or how size matters with needles. These YouTube videos land her on <span class="itali">The </span><span class="itali">Today Show,</span> where she is presented as a modern knitting expert. What follows are books, her own tool line, and a regular feature in <span class="itali">Martha Stewart Living.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id32jgri803">You may find this unlikely. But if you research biographies on successful people, many of their stories unfold like that. A person follows their passion, undeterred by the opinions (and even mockery) of others, and this passion morphs into a grander, more prosperous life. The best part is if you&#x2019;re spending more time doing what you love, you&#x2019;re not waiting for a specific outcome. You&#x2019;re loving the creative process all along, so as it begins to grow, you grow along with it.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id624px5zm3">And everyone has a passion. And for every passion, there are others who share in it. I once saw a bumper sticker that said, <span class="smallcapssc">i brake for jewish cemeteries</span>. I thought, <span class="itali">There</span><span class="itali"> are</span><span class="itali"> enough people into this </span><span class="itali">specific activity </span><span class="itali">that an organization was created to support it</span><span class="itali">,</span><span class="itali"> and they make bumper stickers to promote it.</span> It was a revelation.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2xbr5l3hp">Do you know why passion flourishes? It&#x2019;s because passion itself is contagious. People crave it. Are drawn to it. And need it! You become the vessel for passion, you and the object of your ardor become very attractive indeed. Passion also spreads. Give more of yourself to it, and it will sprout in every area of your life.</p><h1 class="Main-HeadMHead" id="idy3o0woxhf"><span class="boldb">Steps </span><span class="boldb">for Manifesting Your Ideal Career, Soul&#x2019;s Purpose, or Leisure Time</span></h1><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="idwaqxdmhwy"><span class="boldb">Manifesting Reflection Questions on Talents and Skills</span></p><ol class=""><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idxt6syu3lu">What did you love to do as a child?

I know I&#x2019;m not alone in this. It&#x2019;s a side effect of busy lives. But it&#x2019;s important to note that it&#x2019;s usually simpler to heal when a condition begins rather than after it has intensified. After all, it&#x2019;s easier to focus when you&#x2019;re not in debilitating pain. A good rule of thumb is to act quickly in turning a health condition around. At the same time, don&#x2019;t let a long-term condition convince you it can&#x2019;t be healed. I have seen truly miraculous experiences unfold before my eyes. An inoperable brain tumor disappears. Cancer cells in the blood vanish. A multiple sclerosis diagnosis goes asymptomatic. A cranky gallbladder that needs to be removed stops hurting and remains intact. Vision dramatically improves. In some of these cases, the manifestor used medical treatment along with practices like the ones contained in this book. In some others, there was no medical treatment available for the condition, so the person relied on the power of their creative minds. And in all the circumstances I&#x2019;ve just listed, none were expected to heal. An inoperable brain tumor is just that. This person and their family decided to reach outside the conventional to try anything that could help, and that brought them to me. A few of my prayer practitioners and myself used affirmative prayer for this person. Two days later, a test confirmed, it was simply gone. Using these processes along with any medication or treatment you are doing can only be beneficial. You don&#x2019;t have to wait until a seemingly incurable condition presents itself to make manifesting a part of your healing. Make these practices a part of your everyday well-being, and every facet of your life benefits, including your precious body.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idl5r2xv6d2">There are absolutely times a surgery, medication, or other medical treatment <span class="itali">is</span> the answer to a person&#x2019;s healing. Always seek the advice and treatment of a trusted medical professional when needing a physical healing. You can let them know you&#x2019;ll be doing mind-body practices along with their treatment protocol. That may take a bit of courage. Yet I&#x2019;ve found there are more and more doctors who are developing a deeper understanding of the mind-body-spirit connection and are supportive of such practices. The entire field of complementary medicine is dedicated to this.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idel81vfbo6">I recently met my friend Mary Day at a cancer center to visit with her while she underwent chemotherapy. This hospital was a revelation to me! The lobby held a basket for prayer requests and a wire tree with colorful papers attached. Each little sheet contained an inspirational quote or saying you could remove and take with you. All patients have access to support groups, Reiki, massage, and group classes of all types. Inside the elevator doors was a powerful message: &#x201C;Inhale Courage and Exhale Fear.&#x201D; I can assure you that money is being invested in these innovations because there is a deeper understanding happening of the mind-body-spirt connection. People are beginning to understand that this stuff works!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ida9qh56ryl">Every doctor is aware of the placebo effect. This is where a patient is given a fake medication, shot, or procedure. They are told this fake treatment can heal their condition. Some of these patients heal, even though they did not receive any medical treatment at all. They just believed that they had. It&#x2019;s been recognized in medical studies for decades. It&#x2019;s so powerful that medication studies now have to account for it, surmising that a certain percentage of healing can be caused by this effect.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idn0elcqsdn">When you&#x2019;re manifesting for health, the results can demonstrate in a few different ways.</p><ol class=""><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idyh8o392o0">The condition transforms without you making any outward changes.</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="id6mcbrvx6o">You get intuitive &#x201C;downloads&#x201D; on important specific lifestyle changes to make like diet, exercise, alternative, and/or traditional medical care, stress management, or medications and/or supplements.

Ever since I was a punk rock teen, I had wanted to visit England. I collected Union Jack memorabilia, including a cherished T-shirt I wore until it fell apart. Finding an underground for British music magazines, I read up on the latest groups and traded with friends. I felt a true kinship with this country I had never visited. And all these years later, it was <span class="itali">finally</span> happening. I was going to England! The hotel for the conference was the prestigious Royal York. Upon arrival, I looked out of my room&#x2019;s window and was delighted to see an ancient castle wall surrounding the city. I had arrived! But my joy was quickly replaced with overwhelm and fear. Almost no one at this conference had ever heard of me, and I was still an inexperienced speaker. What if I bombed? I kept getting intuitive downloads to speak on spirituality, even though that was not this type of conference. What if the event organizer regretted inviting me? And I humiliated myself in front of my colleagues? Throughout the first day of the event, I was paralyzed with fear, hardly able to take in the other presentations and connect with anyone. It was all I could do to keep from hiding under the table. I left dinner early that evening, returning to my room to review my notes and rehearse the talk. I would be first up the next morning and teaching an all-day workshop the following day.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idsyjm08iud">As I read my notes out loud, something suddenly felt off. I started noticing the need to clear my throat over and over again. My nose had become terribly stuffy. As I wiped my sweaty brow, my skin felt scorching to the touch. Mind you, it was January. I felt my entire body begin to get tight and clammy. I looked in the bathroom mirror, and my face was as red as a tomato. As much as I had been trying to ignore the symptoms, the realization slapped me in the face. I was getting the flu! My body was consumed with the fire of fever. My roommate and dear friend Jondi, another presenter, got back to the room. I sat on the edge of my bed, head in my hands, and began to cry while I shared what was happening. Here I came all this way, to a place I had dreamed of for decades for a chance to speak and teach internationally for the first time ever. And now it would all be ruined. They would have to find a last-minute replacement and I&#x2019;d feel humiliated. My workshop would be canceled. Goodbye to the money I would have made which I very much needed to fund this trip. And I&#x2019;d be sick and alone in a foreign country.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idpa7d7si3t">But, dear readers, I don&#x2019;t give up so easily, not even when all looks impossibly doomed. I have a whole lot of mojo-making manifesting tools in my kit, and this was the time to use them. I texted an SOS to my spiritual community back in New Jersey. They immediately began using affirmative prayer on my behalf. Jondi and I used energy healing practices together. Then I visualized myself on that stage, speaking loudly and proudly. I prayed to release the fear and to be restored to perfect health.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1bzo2lqaa">At this point, I knew. I had done all I could do. I swallowed a week&#x2019;s worth of supplements and guzzled about a half gallon of water, then went to bed. I gave it all over to the Universe and surrendered. I had taken whatever action I could. The rest was up to It.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id8lpxyjlsg">That night, the fire in my body raged. My whole being felt like a boat being tossed about in a stormy sea. The fever dreams felt like fun house hallucinations. A battle for truth versus the lies I had believed about myself was being waged in my subconscious mind. I had never experienced anything like this or since. It must be what a caterpillar feels like during metamorphosis.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id4tnvd3for">In the morning, the second I opened my eyes, I knew. I was healed. My pajamas and bedding were soaked in sweat. Yet I was filled with positive energy. I wasn&#x2019;t even the least bit tired. My roomy vacated early to give me time to prepare. I looked in the mirror, and all I could manage to think was, <span class="itali">Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idiod0ft2lq">That morning, I took the stage, and <span class="itali">I</span><span class="itali"> rocked that mic</span>! Without self-consciousness or apology, I delivered exactly what I wanted to say, exactly the way I wanted to say it. One thing was for certain, they had never seen a speaker quite like me! I was on fire! Not the fire of a fever but the fire of my soul&#x2019;s purpose. My workshop sold out. The following day, I stood for the entire day, teaching, tapping, praying, preaching, and waxing philosophical on healing, manifestation and the creation process. In the window behind me, the grand York Minster could be seen as the unexpected sun illuminated the room. I fell in love with each person there. Everything was right in the world. There was no explaining it. I came to speak on miracles. And it took one to enable me to do it!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1lwyqkk39">That event catapulted my career forward. Gaining much-needed confidence, I came home gushing with gratitude for the grace. There was also an unexpected side effect. I began to blow my own horn. Previously, this would have felt impossible. I didn&#x2019;t like to promote myself, but as one who was newly self-employed, it was now essential. Besides, what good is transformative work if no one knows about it? I was able to speak about my work with passion, sincerity and humility. After all, I got it. There was what I could do and what the Universe could do through me.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idx3n5l5j19">The following year, I was invited back to speak. I got to stand on that very stage with many of the same people present. And I told them this story, tears of appreciation rolling down my face. Everything had changed for me in that year, and it had begun right there. Starting with a seeming catastrophe.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9yzomqqm5">It&#x2019;s a memory I return to time and again when I feel lost or stuck. That night, everything aligned to bring me what I needed, so I could do what needed to be done.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id3izzb5mrv">Now, does this happen every time I feel like I am getting sick? I wish! Thankfully, I hardly ever get colds or flus. And when I do, it&#x2019;s because I have not listened to my body and responded with self-compassion. But if I could have ever chosen a time for a miraculous physical healing, that certainly would have been it.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idyhlmns0gg">The practices I did, and were done on my behalf, coupled with the call of my soul&#x2019;s purpose, aligned to make a mega-manifestation.

It was called Letting Love In. The title was important because most people desiring love think they just have to get out there and find it. They sign up for every possible dating site and app, hoping to finally meet that right person they click with. I wanted to make it clear from the title: love is an inside job. Being available and dating can be an important part of the process. Openness allows new possibilities. And dating can help you get clear on what you really want. In my early twenties, I really wanted to date a musician. That is until I dated a musician! Very quickly, I realized that what I thought I wanted wasn&#x2019;t what I actually wanted. My desires have been upgraded to better match my values and lifestyle since then. And as I grow and change, those desires continue to expand to match more and more of who I am now.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id31aqqz891">Much more than a numbers game, what I found with myself and others that the blocks to love are actually within. Of course they are! Everything is an &#x201C;in-out&#x201D; experience. And there&#x2019;s nothing like a romantic relationship to make you feel your most vulnerable. After all, sharing a life means your person will be there when you wake up in the morning, get bad news, make mistakes, and lose your cool. They will eventually be seeing all of you, unlike the masks we wear during courtship.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id4ahjphngq">And love, all love, can lead to loss. &#x201C;Ah, it is better to have loved and lost than never to have loved before.&#x201D; Very true. Except try saying that to someone who just got dumped! The fodder for a million broken-heart love songs can&#x2019;t be wrong. This area of great vulnerability leaves you open to serious hurt. Those fears of being hurt are like land mines on the love journey. I watch people tiptoe around, controlling, examining, defenses up, watching for any potential wrong move. See if any of these are familiar.</p><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="idmc8kwqknd"><span class="boldb">Hidden Ways We Duck from Love</span></p><ol class=""><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idslasqsfaw">1. Expecting perfection</p><p class="Num-Level-1-List-ParagraphNl1p" id="idlpsr9kx21">The new love must be the perfect everything: job, finances, height, weight, age. &#x201C;She needs to have the minimum of a master&#x2019;s degree, make six figures, run marathons, be a gourmet cook, and own a sailboat.&#x201D; Whenever I would call students on this, I got the same response. &#x201C;I have standards. You said I could manifest what I want.&#x201D; One student who was an artist came to class with a drawing of her future Ms. Right&#x2019;s teeth. Yes, teeth! She was sure she needed her future love to have perfect teeth just like these and felt the illustration would convince me of their necessity. All I saw was someone with inner barriers to love. I told her if Lady Golden Chompers showed up with a crack addiction, she&#x2019;d likely revise her priorities.</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idyzw3ft7h4">2. Focusing on externals</p><p class="Num-Level-1-List-ParagraphNl1p" id="idjfvfnq3cs">See above. Sharing a harmonious life, including housing, finances, and family with another person requires certain qualities. That&#x2019;s the practical side of love. Then there&#x2019;s the spiritual side of the relationship itself. Feeling seen, known, and valued seem to escape the list, but those are extremely important.</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idyjcvs2w9s">3. Fixation on a specific person</p><p class="Num-Level-1-List-ParagraphNl1p" id="id8pwyiqo03">Admittedly, this is an easy hole to fall into. There are times you meet people to whom there is an undeniable attraction. There are many theories on who or what these folks are. I&#x2019;ve heard them all. From past-life soul mates to living triggers of unresolved wounds to tasty temptations to steer you from your true path to many others. They are the most valuable treasure! They are the biggest downfall! The truth is, they can be any of these. I&#x2019;ve seen every conceivable outcome. But I do know this. No matter the circumstance, these people all have a true gift to offer: the feelings they arouse in you. You may think it&#x2019;s all about them. Of course you would. They have brought these feelings to the surface. But those blissful, exuberant, thrilling, passionate feelings are yours alone. And you can use them to attract the relationship of your desires. You just have to let go of it having that face. No matter how adorable. Let the face, body, name, the fact they live in the same neighborhood, so convenient! and you both went to the same college, it&#x2019;s destiny, right? go. Let the container go!</p><p class="Num-Level-1-List-ParagraphNl1p" id="id66f4jmb78"><span class="boldb">Free Will</span></p><p class="Num-Level-1-List-ParagraphNl1p" id="id8eefahyp5">A note here on manipulation and free will. In all cases, trying to manifest anything that involves the specific behavior of others is not only unethical, it&#x2019;s karmically unadvisable. You can hold the tantalizing contract you&#x2019;d like to get in your mind without simultaneously wishing your competitor does not win it. You can focus on the qualities of love you&#x2019;d like without making it &#x201C;that person.&#x201D; Trying to make anyone the answer to your prayers is dangerous. They may be the answer to someone else&#x2019;s prayers. Or they may have qualities more akin to a nightmare than a dream. You just can&#x2019;t see it now. Focus on the qualities and feelings, but let the idea of the specific vessel go. Manipulation is bad mojo. Don&#x2019;t undermine the good you&#x2019;re creating by inviting a boomerang bang from the Universe. If this is difficult advice to follow, use the processes in chapter 234, &#x201C;Dealing with Doubts and Releasing Resistance.&#x201D;</p></li></ol><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idnutkxgwd3">When manifesting, there are times our inner control freak takes over and wants to force the Universe. I&#x2019;ve seen this phenomenon no stronger than when creating romantic relationships. And it will never, ever get you what you most desire. When this happens, hear your inner control freak out. Let it express its demands. Then send love to this part of yourself and turn these demands over to the Universe. Surrender and offer them up. If you have to repeat this process a hundred times, then do it a hundred times. The Universe will know just how to manage this aspect of yourself so that it doesn&#x2019;t block love.</p><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="idc2wmqp5oi"><span class="boldb">General Love Attracting Principles</span></p><ol class=""><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="iddb1twdma1">1. Embrace all love</p><p class="Num-Level-1-List-ParagraphNl1p" id="id2xg29v0ar">It may not be the source you expected. It may not look the way you want. But love is all around you. When we can embrace the love we are offered in our everyday experiences, our love quotient grows. The more we let in, the more there is. The more there is, the more satiated we are. Then your person can come into a love oasis rather than a desperate desert.</p><p class="Num-Level-1-List-ParagraphNl1p" id="idw7duccnuh">When my father passed away a few years ago, I was simultaneously going through major transitions in every area of my life. This created a perfect storm of emotional overwhelm. I went into survival mode, going day by day, moment by moment. Not always the best at asking for help, now there was no choice. I needed support. The oddest thing happened. A lot of the people I thought would be there for me weren&#x2019;t. And people I had never expected to offer support did. And for once, I released all criteria and expectation. I let the people who could support me do so. It was so freeing! And not only that, I didn&#x2019;t get bitter about the people who couldn&#x2019;t step forward. My needs were being met. That was all that mattered. If I had fallen into self-pity and blame, thinking, <span class="itali">But I was there for her and she was never there for me,</span> an already challenging time period would have become more so.</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idusjez6v67">2. Celebrate love</p><p class="Num-Level-1-List-ParagraphNl1p" id="id5qgp17h4y">When you spend time with couples who have the type of relationship you&#x2019;d like, celebrate them. This can include famous couples as well. It doesn&#x2019;t mean you have to throw them a party or make your appreciation overt. Pay attention. Notice what it is about their love that is appealing. Is it the way they finish each other&#x2019;s sentences? Or how they speak with kindness and tenderness to one another? Is it that they always have each other&#x2019;s backs? Hold on to that valuable information.</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="iddzpfo4fsg">3. What you don&#x2019;t want</p><p class="Num-Level-1-List-ParagraphNl1p" id="idwqzdv1hkp">On the flip side, notice romantic relationships that make you cringe. This will be easy to find. If you somehow only know happy couples, check out a reality show or two. What makes you uncomfortable? Do they seem distant and vacant with one another? Is it the barely contained contempt? Is one taking advantage of the other? Make note of this valuable information. You&#x2019;ll be able to find the positive opposites of their behaviors and add them to your growing clarity on love.</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idulj700z4o">4. Forget type</p><p class="Num-Level-1-List-ParagraphNl1p" id="idrsf14yvou">A friend of mine shared something surprising with me. He swore he&#x2019;d never date a Latina woman because he found them &#x201C;too traditional.&#x201D; He told me this while sitting next to his very untraditional, brilliant, and gorgeous Latina wife. In my years of teaching the course, almost every one of my students attracted a love relationship that violated some made up rule they had carried. &#x201C;I would never date anyone in a blue-collar job.&#x201D; &#x201C;They have to be in a three-year age range as I am, plus or minus.&#x201D; Love can and often does come in unexpected packages. It happened so frequently, I began to wonder, where did these &#x201C;rules&#x201D; come from in the first place? I believe it can be the nature of resistance. It doesn&#x2019;t mean you don&#x2019;t have standards. In fact, you may need to expand those standards. It just means don&#x2019;t get hung up on ultimately what&#x2019;s not important. Your next or forever love may indeed be a short, rounded girl with red hair and glasses. Or she may be a tall, thin, willowy blonde. If it&#x2019;s love and the attraction is both powerful and mutual, does it matter? When you find it, you will know, it does not.</p></li></ol><p class="B-HeadBhead" id="id3lv7luwgu"><span class="boldb">Levels of Love Connection</span><span class="boldb">&#x2014;</span><span class="boldb">Delve Below the Physical</span></p><ol class=""><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="id6qkvyawcq">1. Physical</p><p class="Num-Level-1-List-ParagraphNl1p" id="idxgdusae5a">This is normally where love manifestors focus exclusively. Not only does this include physical attributes like height, weight, and eye color but career, education, finances, location, age, lifestyle choices, and family of origin. I advise you to keep aspects of this general. When it comes to physical appearance, here is something to focus on or ask for that never disappoints:</p><p class="Num-Level-1-List-ParagraphNl1p" id="idydd00i3i0">&#x201C;My new love is wildly attracted to me, and I am wildly attracted to them.&#x201D;</p><p class="Num-Level-1-List-ParagraphNl1p" id="idwiy18br1j">Because I can assure you, this is all that matters. If magnetic, passionate attraction is important to you&#x2014;and it is for most&#x2014;then affirm that this is what you will feel for one another. I have dated extremely attractive men that I was not attracted to, no matter how often I told myself I should be. Let go of the package and embrace how you&#x2019;d like to feel and that the feeling is completely mutual. Just thinking of them and your heart beats faster is a sweet place to focus.</p><p class="Num-Level-1-List-ParagraphNl1p" id="id8iqnbrxnb">With finances, I&#x2019;d stay away from exact dollar figures and affirm instead:</p><p class="Num-Level-1-List-ParagraphNl1p" id="idhp6eer5p1">&#x201C;My new love is financially responsible and secure.&#x201D;</p><p class="Num-Level-1-List-ParagraphNl1p" id="idpqfjadf89">Here are a few clarity questions for the physical level:</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idcrwsw77y5">2.

Also important is to define spiritual connection here for yourself. Perhaps you want to feel like you&#x2019;ve known this person before. Or that the connection is otherworldly.

Always. You think you want &#x201C;it,&#x201D; the great job, lover, or trip. But what you really want is how having these will make you feel. Accomplished. Purposeful. Loved. Valued. Excited. Intrigued. Glamorous. Go for the feeling state, always, and your manifestation may look as you expected or be a complete surprise. Either way, you will feel how you&#x2019;ve been wanting to feel.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idkel71c9fl">One of the gifts of my private practice is I get to deeply know people from every conceivable culture, background, and status. When I work with individuals with great beauty, success, picture-perfect families, and no financial concerns, I find they still have pain. They can be as anxious, insecure, and unhappy as people with much less. What good are the goods if they don&#x2019;t <span class="itali">feel</span> good?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idj2wkw39jy">Everyone from advertisers to politicians know that the majority of people make decisions based on feelings rather than logic. If you asked someone why they voted for the candidate of their choice in the last presidential election, they will likely say things such as, &#x201C;I just like them. They speak to me. I trust what they say.&#x201D; Most choose based on emotion. It&#x2019;s why ads try to motivate you with either fear or love or inspiration. We&#x2019;re either running away from something scary or toward something good. It&#x2019;s far easier to manipulate people with fear.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id5gbfiscrk">If you want to manifest like a champion, understanding and working with emotions will be a key piece of the process. When I meet people who&#x2019;ve become fed up with the law of attraction, it&#x2019;s this essential knowledge that was missing from their education.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idvgxnhhg6p">But what about negativity?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idhkpbw022x">There is a huge misnomer in popular culture about negativity. You want to manifest but believe you must deny all negative thoughts and feelings to do so. If you don&#x2019;t, these &#x201C;oogie boogies&#x201D; will attract bad experiences. This has created great fear and repression in spiritual communities. And I&#x2019;m here to say, this is not so. I know. I tried it that way for years, and it did not work. The more I denied the uncomfortable feelings, the worse I felt, and the worse I felt, the less I manifested. There is a better, more holistic, more grounded way to honor your emotional lives and still create what you want. And let me be clear: negative thoughts and emotions that are repressed are <span class="itali">not</span> gone. You may not be thinking or feeling them at the moment, but they still are ever present in your energy field.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id4jw5gsjuq">First, if you&#x2019;re having a human experience, you will have negative thoughts and feelings. Say them out loud, don&#x2019;t say them, pretend they&#x2019;re not there, it doesn&#x2019;t matter. The energy behind them exists whether you give words to them or not. Your energy speaks far louder than anything you say or do. And it can only be truthful. Trying to not have negative thoughts and feelings is crazy-making. Then we develop negative thoughts and feelings about our negative thoughts and feelings! Accept and process those thoughts and feelings, and your positivity quotient will grow exponentially.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idm8m3oeqdb">If you have a negative feeling about a family member, it came from somewhere. That energy is within you. Maybe they remind you of a parent you had a challenging relationship with. Or their behavior is hitting up against a firmly held belief. &#x201C;Oh, Stephanie only thinks about herself! And no one ever listens to me.&#x201D; If you process what&#x2019;s behind that negative feeling, your reaction to this family member can change, often dramatically. So instead of pretending you feel fine around this person, you will actually <span class="itali">be</span> legitimately fine. Imagine doing that with every trigger you encounter. This, folks, is true freedom. You&#x2019;ll realize you don&#x2019;t have to go live in a cave to avoid being activated.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2c8nf1r38">Second, there is a very fine line between taking responsibility for your life and blaming yourself for its experiences. I do believe we create our own realities and we are responsible for our lives. I also know that creation process is influenced by ancestry, culture, and community, among other things. We can transform those influences that get in the way of our joy. Thank goodness for that. But if we&#x2019;re so busy beating up on ourselves for everything not working in our lives, we have less energy to do that.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idk4h6rb5ct">Thoughts are much easier to manage. Thoughts are clean. You hear them. You can write them down. Then you can turn them around and come up with a positive affirmation to counteract them. When I think of thoughts, I see a man in a professional suit. Simple. Orderly. All business.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2uzwu1neb">Emotions, on the other hand, are messy! They can really hurt our hearts. And it&#x2019;s human nature to avoid pain. We have centuries of this avoidance behind us. After all, do you think your great-great-grandparents had the luxury of working out their feelings? Likely they were too busy surviving. Now we even have entire spiritual systems based on emotional avoidance. I see emotions like a passionate, wild, red-haired woman crashing a formal event. She will not be denied. Better let her in and hear what she&#x2019;s got to say.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9p4drsle7">Most people enter this work thinking, <span class="itali">I</span><span class="itali">&#x2019;</span><span class="itali">ll get what I want</span><span class="itali">,</span><span class="itali"> and then I</span><span class="itali">&#x2019;</span><span class="itali">ll be happy.</span> It&#x2019;s actually the reverse. You get happy and then what you want comes. Releasing stress and processing pain will be a part of your happiness prescription, no waiting necessary.</p><p class="List-HeadLhead" id="id8n1g9nup2"><span class="boldb">Emotions 101</span></p><ol class=""><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idbb0xztqqf">1. Emotions aren&#x2019;t (just) in your head.</p><p class="Num-Level-1-List-ParagraphNl1p" id="id3k4d8xth4">The stressful narrative you&#x2019;re running about why you&#x2019;re feeling the way you&#x2019;re feeling is in your conscious mind. But that&#x2019;s not where the actual emotions are. They are in your energy field, which comprises the entire body. The emotions may rest in your knotted stomach or in that electricity running up and down your back.</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="id55idwrems">2. Talking yourself out of a feeling doesn&#x2019;t always work.</p><p class="Num-Level-1-List-ParagraphNl1p" id="idxacz5klyf">See #1. There are times when thoughts can neutralize emotions, but not usually. If the thoughts try in any way to negate or judge the experience, the feelings will actually intensify. For example, your coworker takes credit for your idea. You feel betrayed and angry. If you start thinking thoughts such as, <span class="itali">He didn</span><span class="itali">&#x2019;</span><span class="itali">t mean it. I</span><span class="itali">&#x2019;</span><span class="itali">m probably overreacting.</span> You have denied the feelings. Two weeks later, you&#x2019;re putting a fist into his birthday cake. Oops! The feelings didn&#x2019;t go away. They just waited until a weak and unguarded moment to take over.</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idrfiqok6xk">3. You probably never learned effective emotional processing growing up. But you can now.</p><p class="Num-Level-1-List-ParagraphNl1p" id="id230aeaem3">This is an essential life skill. We are fortunate to be able to do these processes now. Let go of any blame for parents/caregivers/teachers. No one can teach you what they themselves didn&#x2019;t know. Much of what we now know about emotions is recent information.</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="id54sh4b722">4. Emotions are not logical.</p><p class="Num-Level-1-List-ParagraphNl1p" id="id3rry2g3lu">See #1 and #2. Once you recognize this, you can accept emotions for what they are rather than trying to debate them.</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idc2iqj00e1">5. Emotions are information.</p><p class="Num-Level-1-List-ParagraphNl1p" id="idedepj5yvn">They are telling you something about how you interpret the world and everything in it. Be willing to listen.</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idwpqrq3jdo">6. Suppression (ultimately) hurts worse than feeling the feelings.</p><p class="Num-Level-1-List-ParagraphNl1p" id="idi6h5gxwm7">Any temporary relief from stuffing down or denying your uncomfortable feelings will be short-lived. Those feelings still exist within your energy field and body tissues. They can cause a lot of other physical and emotional problems. Isn&#x2019;t it better to deal with them now?</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idz416ssbln">7. All emotions are a part of one spectrum.</p><p class="Num-Level-1-List-ParagraphNl1p" id="id6lm36mma8">When you suppress your anger, anxiety, and grief, it is much more difficult to feel the positive emotions you crave&#x2014;like joy, happiness, and love.</p></li></ol><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id17og7guzs">Here&#x2019;s how to begin a regular practice of what I call emotional alchemy:</p><aside data-type="sidebar" class="box"><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="id9l5cfm6kh"><span class="boldb">Manifesting Mini Process: </span><span class="boldb">Introduction to </span><span class="boldb">Emotional Alchemy</span></p><ol class=""><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="ideckj58ufc">1.

Journal.</p></li></ol><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2asnnb92z">I recommend this over and over and over again because it works. A journal is a safe place for your feelings to be unloaded without harming anyone. Bring pen to paper and keep writing until you&#x2019;ve emptied out. Don&#x2019;t censor or analyze. Just regurgitate onto the page. Be as mean, vengeful, and toxic as you&#x2019;d like.

And the top habits that take us away from our good? Self-criticism, self-blame, and shame. You are a beloved child of the Universe, exactly as you are.

And haven&#x2019;t we seen in recent political polls of all types just how far off they can be? And I also want to say, so what? Yes, so what if unemployment rose in your demographic?

Having written two plays while still in high school, she majored in literature and, postcollege, landed a job in publishing. Her days became filled with reading other people&#x2019;s writing. Often, a voice in her head said, <span class="itali">You could have written that! You</span><span class="itali">&#x2019;</span><span class="itali">re better than this.</span> Movies, with their predictable plotlines and trite dialogue, frustrated her. This is an area she could shine; she was sure of it. She decided to write for one hour each evening after dinner but found herself too tired to be inspired. How about getting up an hour earlier to write? she thought. This well-intentioned solution lasted for all of four days. Suddenly, she began staying up much later than usual, watching movies until 2:00 a.m., unable to turn off the remote. Her mornings a washout, she was barely getting to work on time. Let alone writing. Valerie had encountered resistance and did not know what to do about it.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idi8qop1skp">I used a technique with Valerie called <span class="itali">T</span><span class="itali">apping</span> to bust through her resistance. (See page TK for instructions.) The normal excuses came up. &#x201C;I work so hard. I want to watch movies at night. It&#x2019;s my only relaxation. Don&#x2019;t I deserve to enjoy something I really love?&#x201D; But as we continued to tap, what came up was a fear of failure. Here she had spent years telling herself how much better she was than the authors she worked with. What if she had been wrong all along?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id5a3gk3mqe">As we tapped, I asked her, &#x201C;If you failed, what&#x2019;s the worst that could happen?&#x201D; She spit out a long list of terrible, but extremely unlikely, possibilities. Everything from &#x201C;All my friends will leave me&#x201D; to &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll have nothing to live for.&#x201D; As we continued tapping, more likely scenarios presented themselves. &#x201C;It will be all my fault. I had a gift and I ignored it,&#x201D; and &#x201C;I&#x2019;m such an egomaniac! Who am I to judge any working writer?&#x201D; Once we neutralized all these thoughts, Valerie was able to forgive herself. She realized her jealousy had been a painful gift. It was telling her, &#x201C;You have a talent, but don&#x2019;t believe you can be successful at it.&#x201D; That&#x2019;s what jealousy says to us all. &#x201C;I want that, but I don&#x2019;t believe I can have it, so I&#x2019;m bitter about the person who does.&#x201D; The problem is jealousy feels so painful, we often turn away from the gift. Neutralize the doubt in your ability to have what you want, and the jealousy disappears. Often those people you are jealous of can be way-showers. They are living examples of what is possible and may have a blueprint, tips, or simply hope to assist you on your journey.</p><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="idsverr1ttr"><span class="boldb">Manifesting Resistance Busters: Tapping</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idfy6f8239r"><span class="itali">T</span><span class="itali">apping</span> is a term used to describe methods of using the fingers to rhythmically tap on the meridian points used in acupuncture.

It&#x2019;s also a bridge to the subconscious mind, so it&#x2019;s ideal for revealing hidden causes behind destructive behaviors.

Lots and lots of practices! Ones for your mind, emotions, body, spirit, and energy. This way you can approach manifesting from every conceivable angle, using all the levels and dimensions of your being. Some require very little but an open mind and a bit of time. Others involve more delving and effort. Please don&#x2019;t be overwhelmed. You&#x2019;re learning not just new exercises but a different way of being.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idz80f0cjdw">Here are some reminders and a format that can work well:</p><ol class=""><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idby2m5p1qr">1. Start small.</p><p class="Num-Level-1-List-ParagraphNl1p" id="idr49wvsdan">Even though I&#x2019;ve manifested for many years, I still like to remind and reinforce what is possible for myself. I do this by manifesting the parking spot, the best appointment time, the perfect concert buddy. Regularly, I am flexing my manifesting muscles.</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idyozedomv2">2. Choose one area to work on at a time.</p><p class="Num-Level-1-List-ParagraphNl1p" id="idcb8ta3tac">Please trust me on this one. I stubbornly would try to manifest in several areas at once, usually with dismal results. When you first learn to manifest, it can feel like being that kid in the candy store. &#x201C;I want this! And I want that!&#x201D; You do not want to turn into Veruca Salt from the film <span class="itali">Willy Wonka </span><span class="itali">&amp;</span><span class="itali"> </span><span class="itali">the Chocolate Factory.</span> That was the spoiled little girl who wanted the golden-egg-laying goose. &#x201C;I want it all, Daddy, and I want it now!&#x201D; When you&#x2019;ve been experiencing lack for a long time, this is a natural side effect. You want your bigger life, and yesterday! Just remember, you&#x2019;ll never get it all done. This isn&#x2019;t an assignment to be turned in by a specific date. This is a new lifestyle. And you&#x2019;ll accomplish much more, in a shorter period of time, if your energy is focused on one manifestation at a time.</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="id6hg6wbrkq">3. Explore the practices you&#x2019;d love to do and the ones that scare you.</p><p class="Num-Level-1-List-ParagraphNl1p" id="id626cme8ki">If an exercise in the book brings up strong feelings, both positive and negative, then start with those. The positive ones will be easy. There&#x2019;s something already attractive about them that you&#x2019;re responding to. But what about the negative ones? The ones you really, really don&#x2019;t want to do? Those are sparking up your resistance to change. That&#x2019;s where the gold is. Certainly, embark on those. And the ones that make you go <span class="itali">eh</span>? Forget them for now. They just don&#x2019;t resonate at this time. With books like these, you can return again and again. And those &#x201C;eh practices&#x201D; may feel right at a later time.</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idla9y250vq">4. Set aside manifesting time.</p><p class="Num-Level-1-List-ParagraphNl1p" id="idk97pqj8ks">Find the right time of day or the perfect day of the week, and put manifesting time on your calendar. When you actually schedule personal growth time, you&#x2019;re sending a signal to your subconscious and the Universe that you mean business! Block out distractions and minimize interruptions. Unless you&#x2019;re using your smartphone as a part of your manifesting process, turn it off. Make manifesting an enjoyable experience you look forward to, rather than another item on your to-do list. You&#x2019;ve decided to become more of what your soul came here to be. You&#x2019;re forgetting the status quo and becoming a Conscious Creator. This is exciting! Light a candle. Play soft, relaxing, meditative music in the background. Make this time an oasis you&#x2019;re happy to come into.</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idzmy6bpfgw">5. Get support.</p><p class="Num-Level-1-List-ParagraphNl1p" id="id8ve91edx3">Enlist the support of a fellow manifestor or accountability partner. Form a mastermind group or book club group so you have folks to share in the adventure and keep you motivated.</p><p class="Num-Level-1-List-ParagraphNl1p" id="idvbg9wp1q4">Form a group that is working toward specific goals and mutually support one another with ideas, brainstorming, accountability, and spiritual practices.</p></li><li class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1"><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idfx7ppylja">6.

And by &#x201C;completing,&#x201D; in true ADD fashion, I actually mean, &#x201C;writing the majority of.&#x201D; This winter saw the arrival of the COVID-19 coronavirus, and everyday life around the globe has been upended, bringing people everywhere face-to-face with painful fears. There&#x2019;s been significant loss, and most everyone is struggling with how to keep moving forward with nothing but uncertainty meeting them each day.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idzvidx6mti">Others are getting clear about what&#x2019;s most important to them, going within, taking time for renewal, learning more about themselves and the people closest to them, reevaluating their truest values and using the downtime to appreciate all that they have. There&#x2019;s a massive wakeup call happening.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idecyj0qizo">My experience has been unique.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1gbk02xgx">Overnight, as news of the virus broke, I experienced a synching up, a clicking in, into an alignment with a Power Greater Than Myself. It was like the Universe was tapping me on the shoulder and pulling me into the game. In my mind, the Universe took the form of gravel-voiced Mickey, the boxing coach for Rocky, from the famous movie. &#x201C;Get in there, kid! They need ya!&#x201D; A powerful surge of energy saturated my entire being, and I was bounding out of bed each morning, ready to don my superhero cape and get to work. Instantaneously, my private practice quadrupled. A lot of the one-on-one work I do is with folks with crippling anxiety. Suddenly, we had all been dropped into the Super Bowl of anxiety, and I was going for Most Valuable Player. I had a singular, all-pervasive focus: serve absolutely everyone I possibly could. Clients peeled through layers of past wounds faster than ever before. Core issues rose to the surface and were cleared. I know an enormous amount about creating emotional relief, and now was the time to share these skills in a bigger way. I offered a free online group energy healing, and a hundred people attended. So I turned this into a weekly event that lasted nine weeks. My writing shifted from this book to my newsletter, offering weekly doses of comfort, compassion, and stress-relieving practices to help navigate this confusing terrain. For almost six weeks, I worked six and a half days a week, from twelve to eighteen hours per day and somehow managed to shop, cook, do laundry, and walk in nature as much as I could. Nature offered moments of absolute bliss. I experienced more clearly than I ever had before: I am one with everything. (We <span class="itali">all</span> are one with everything.) One with the towering trees. One with flowering cherry blossoms. One with the droplets of rain. One with the reflection of light dancing across the pond. Everything felt both more mysterious and yet clearer than ever before. If only people knew they could get this high organically! The oddest aspect of it all was my sense of humor became heightened to the point of the absurd. I shared funny memes and texted jokes to anyone who could stand me. I acted like a bit of smartass in the chat feature under our governor&#x2019;s daily briefings. His sign language interpreter was a handsome man. Among everyone&#x2019;s complaints, I would disperse a funny comment here and there, like, &#x201C;Is it wrong that I wish he were signing with his shirt off?&#x201D; or &#x201C;It would be hard to stay six feet from him!&#x201D; It made people laugh when these were in short supply. I felt compelled to add just a little bit of levity in all the seriousness, adopting a new role, the holy fool. Dancing to the overhead music in grocery stores while I scanned the ransacked shelves, there were moments when I would look around at the bewildered reactions of other shoppers. One woman barked through her mask, &#x201C;What the f&#x2014;are you so happy about?!&#x201D; I wish I&#x2019;d had an answer for her. But I know from experience, supernatural experiences are ones to be lived now and examined later. And often that examination is futile. I didn&#x2019;t know why this was happening to me, I just knew it was meant to happen. My humanness had been relegated to the back seat by my spirit. I could occasionally hear Human Kris softly in the background, eking out concerns. &#x201C;Do we have enough toilet paper? What if there are food shortages? We are so alone.&#x201D; Super Spirit Kris heard her. Listened. Met her with compassion. Then didn&#x2019;t let it slow her down for one second. I was on a mission. And I felt a greater trust in the Universe than ever before. I felt protected, guided, and very much loved.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idymjin3eci">You can imagine that this was difficult to explain to family and friends. Everyone was scrambling to make sense of what was happening, forming opinions, and doing everything in their power to feel safe. The people in my life ran the gamut on responses, from those who hadn&#x2019;t left their homes in months to the virus deniers refusing to wear masks, with every possible variation in between. Miraculously, surprisingly, I was in complete non-judgment of them all. After all, I didn&#x2019;t know any of the answers myself, just what was mine to do. I wanted everyone to feel safe and honored whatever they needed to do to feel that way. And I prayed for safety for humanity as a whole. That if there are lessons to be learned, we are learning them in the gentlest ways possible. It was one of many confirmations of just what a profound spiritual experience this was. Human Kris can be quite judgy, even, admittedly, a tad self-righteous at times. But Super Spirit Kris sees only love. Super Spirit Kris knows we are all doing the best we can. Super Spirit Kris allows herself to be used for the greater good. And yet just because I was feeling that way toward others, it didn&#x2019;t mean everyone was able to return this sentiment in kind.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idyyqkjkodi">Not everyone will be okay with you being okay when they&#x2019;re not okay.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idefzs0g659">That can happen on this Magical Mystery Manifestation Mission. You are stepping back from an accepted status quo reality, taking control of your consciousness, and making life work for you as you learn to work with life. You are becoming an Alchemist. Be prepared that not everyone will be thrilled with this. Yet the best way you can help others and the world is to become a master manifestor anyway. This gives you resources to share. And not just resources but the knowledge that they too can create a life of more. More love, more money, more health, more joy. It&#x2019;s available for every one of us.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idxzs54wf0c">You can become okay with others not being okay with you.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id8wjyx3l9d">Not immediately, but in time, you will become comfortable with a new normal. And all the benefits will keep you moving forward even when facing criticism from people you love.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idbyxop95ok">After about six weeks, my supernatural experience came crashing down into the same humanness everyone else was experiencing. I had bouts of uncertainty, confusion, and an aching loneliness that I couldn&#x2019;t quite shake. Along with it, I began grieving for that supernatural experience. After all, who doesn&#x2019;t want to have boundless energy, enthusiasm, love, and faith in the face of terror? I just wasn&#x2019;t ready to let it go. I wanted to feel that way all the time. And yet, even during that time of questioning, my needs were covered.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idytsy72i0y">My point in sharing this story is very important. Even during a worldwide pandemic, economic collapse, and terrifying riots, when everything felt wrong and nothing felt right, I was and am okay. And often, a whole lot more than okay. I did fulfilling work and expressed my creativity in writing and photos, all while I expanded my business. And here I am, now completing this book. Summer of 2020 has now given way to autumn as I complete my revisions. The leaves are beginning to change, and many of us are wondering when the constant changes we&#x2019;ve endured will come to a stop. I miss teaching in person and traveling. And I am still okay. Most days, I am still way more than just okay. There is some modicum of what I have come to call <span class="itali">financial survivor</span><span class="itali">&#x2019;</span><span class="itali">s guilt</span> to process. Along with session fees and group donations, unexpected gifts and money have shown up in my life during a time when many people are suffering. No man or woman is an island. What good is my bounty when so many around me are in financial chaos? I&#x2019;ve given and donated more than ever before. And the entire time, I am knowing: we all inherently have the power within us to create a whole new world here. One that works for everyone. One in which all people are safe, healthy, prosperous, happy, and free. This may be the darkness before the dawn, and I am envisioning that dawn. I hope you all will join me in that.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idjuqn5y26n">Here lies this book. I&#x2019;ve provided a road map to not only actively create what you want but to cultivate an inner place of trust and safety in the Universe. Am I actually saying this information could change the world? Yes, I am saying just that. These are the principles that have been creating each stage of evolution since the dawn of time. As you can change yourself and your life, so too you can have a tremendous effect on the world.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idxdvoah2g8">Throughout this difficult time, besides daily energy work and prayer, I have returned to using these very tools. And I want you to know that I have been given everything I need. Absolutely. Everything.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idps1u2st6l">A few examples:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idexi9kelu2">After a long day of writing, I realized my refrigerator was empty. I had to choose between a much-needed walk so my body didn&#x2019;t atrophy or get food to make a quality dinner. My sad handful of broken plantain chips and can of tuna wasn&#x2019;t exactly calling to me. My across-the-hall neighbor, Marc, texted. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m making homemade turkey soup. Would you like some?&#x201D; Did I ever! After my walk, I arrived home to find a complete meal carefully arranged on a paper towel on my doormat. There was a beautiful postcard propped beside it. The message said, &#x201C;We&#x2019;re so glad you&#x2019;re our neighbor.&#x201D; Delicious, healthy, filling, and fulfilling, I ingested the energy of kindness and generosity infused in each bite.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id3o8lzrlq9">A few years ago, I had purchased metal angel wings from an arts-and-crafts store. During COVID quarantine, I wanted to continue to support them as a customer. On a whim, I checked out the store&#x2019;s website, hoping to find other angel wing products, but their stock was low and the leftovers didn&#x2019;t appeal to me. The next day, my friend Ki&#x2019;Mani offered to bring me an herbal bath she&#x2019;d concocted, along with yummy homemade food. I met her outside, standing back from her car so we could catch up while socially distanced, when the sun illuminated something in her back seat. &#x201C;Are those metal angel wings?&#x201D; I asked.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idermx5zwr2">&#x201C;Yes! Do you want them?&#x201D; she replied.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idpgkjj4tuz">Pulling them out, I was stunned at how beautiful and enormous they were. She had purchased them months before, and they didn&#x2019;t fit in her space. I was surprised to find the tags on the wings were from the same store I had been perusing.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idadloom4xp">On a particularly lonely day when I was feeling exhausted and more than a little sorry for myself, I left my urban dwelling for my daily nature escape. Humanness was in charge that day. I had been working so hard and suddenly felt like I wanted this to be witnessed by somebody, anybody. I just needed an &#x201C;attagirl&#x201D; pat on the back. Stopping at the mailbox, there were two cards. One had come all the way from Holland. My dearest friend, Veronique, had included a package of brightly colored tissue paper Easter eggs. My eyes lit up as if they were Faberg&#xE9; eggs! She said, &#x201C;In these very difficult times, you are a beacon of light! Please know, I love you so very much.&#x201D; I exploded with tears. It was exactly what I needed to hear, exactly when I needed to hear it. Even though it had taken two weeks, this card had arrived exactly on time. The other was from my sweet friend Regina, an exceptional massage therapist who&#x2019;d had to place her practice on hold due to coronavirus quarantine. She shared, &#x201C;I want to let you know how special you are. I admire your willingness and open heart to provide your deeply effective online healing sessions during this tumultuous time.&#x201D; In thankfulness, she offered me three massages! On my walk, all I could do was weep. I felt loved. Seen. Appreciated. All whining had disappeared in an instant, replaced by gratitude. I wasn&#x2019;t alone after all.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idkkbq5awbm">I got a text from Venmo. A generous and beloved client sent me a large sum of money. I assumed it was for future session fees. Instead, it was an appreciation of gratitude for the work I had done with her and her family. As she explained this, I burst into tears. This &#x201C;tip&#x201D; allowed me to take a bit of much needed time off for writing this book.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2ei5w4ryn">Then there were countless other generosities. My friend Mary Kay sewed four very pretty masks for me from sugar-skull-themed fabric, which get compliments every time I wear one. Then she dropped off a package of paper plates when on social media, I had offered up my mother in exchange for some! Again, another joke from the holy fool. I was just so tired of doing dishes all the time! Gorgeous original art arrived from my friends Sylvia and Desiree. Much-needed neck and shoulder support came in a luxurious aromatherapy wrap from Shaina. But wait, there&#x2019;s more! A slew of books. (And I <span class="itali">love</span> books!) More delicious homemade food. Lots of other greeting cards. An antique typewriter for my collection. Hilarious texts. A deepening friendship with a former acquaintance. Factor in super sweet emails from happy clients and readers of my first book, and you can see why I felt so supported at a time when it was desperately needed.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idib7o6pvzn">All of it allowed me to serve from fullness, filled with grace. It wasn&#x2019;t that I was in denial of what was happening. I lost someone I knew personally. Three friends lost parents. My hospice volunteer mother said goodbye to two dear colleagues. Some of my favorite local businesses will likely not reopen. All my speaking and teaching gigs have been canceled, including my weekly energy sessions with blind and visually impaired students. I miss them so much! Like everyone, there&#x2019;s a lot I am missing. And events happening right now have left my friends of color and parents of children of color reeling. For me, being a spiritual being doesn&#x2019;t mean living in an alternate reality bubble. It does mean that as I take in reality, I respond with compassion and understanding, for my own reactions and for where others are. I do all that I can to be a source of love, including loving and being tender with myself. Then the more I am able to be that for others. I focus on imagining a world that works for everyone. What that can look like. How it would feel. I can educate myself, find what is mine to do, and get actively involved. I&#x2019;m best able to do that when I&#x2019;ve created a life where my own needs are being met. When my bills are paid. And I&#x2019;m sleeping well. When my emotional and physical well-being is vibrant. When I feel safe and loved. When I have people in my life who understand oddball me. When life and I are working together, rather than against each other. From that stable foundation, I can make a greater impact. Have a more pronounced effect. If you want to change the world, start where you are. Prove to yourself you can do, be, and have more. Then share that more with others who need it. I honestly do believe we can have societies where everyone is fed, clothed, housed, educated, safe, fulfilled, and free. It just needs more of us manifestors to help usher in a better world. I&#x2019;m in. I hope you&#x2019;ll join me.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id15derf61z">There is nothing exceptional about me, I can assure you. Students will sometimes say, &#x201C;Sure, that&#x2019;s fine for you. Easy for you to say. You&#x2019;re a mystical, spiritual badass who lives this stuff. I have a full-time job and an elderly parent I&#x2019;m caring for. I&#x2019;m just a regular person. I&#x2019;m not special.&#x201D; I remind them, they are all just as special or not special as I am. The Universe does not discriminate. In its eyes, we are all equal. I wasn&#x2019;t born under a lucky star. And I can assure you, no sane person, upon hearing my life story, would ever trade places with me. I&#x2019;ve had more struggle, heartache, and adversity than most. And all of those painful experiences fueled the growth that has brought me to this place. I&#x2019;m deeply in love with my life. Here&#x2019;s what may set me apart: I work these principles and practices. Practices are designed to be just that, practiced. I take my life and happiness seriously. I don&#x2019;t settle for mediocre because I&#x2019;ve learned I don&#x2019;t have to. And neither do you. I worked at this for long enough that I reached a time when I no longer had to. Most often, blessings flow into my life. And when I hit walls, I know how to heal them, so flow can be restored once again.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idouly18291">Like in cooking, follow the steps of the recipes that I&#x2019;ve shared here. Track your efforts and the results. What paid off and what didn&#x2019;t? Which did you enjoy? Which ones would you never do again? Pay attention. To your thoughts and feelings. To your experiences. Mind your excuses. Heal the resistance. And work what works. Work it with wild abandon. Work it with joy. And rejoice in all the ever-flowing good that comes.</p><blockquote data-type="epigraph" class=""><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="idkpb82wx5z">Do not be dismayed by the brokenness of the world. All things break. And all things can be mended. Now with time, as they say, but with intention. So go. Love intentionally, extravagantly, unconditionally. The broken world waits in darkness for the light that is you.</p><p class="Epigraph-SourceEpisrc" id="iddozdq5x0u">&#x2014;I.R.

Leaving a lengthy career as a social service counselor to guide others in the energy and metaphysical practices she had used to heal herself, Kris empowers others through the profound promise that everyone can move from surviving to thriving. She frequently speaks to diverse groups on how purpose, love, faith, and balanced energy are the ancient antidotes to modern stress caused by our current climate of constant uncertainty. A lifelong learner in the areas of personal growth, healing, and religious/spiritual history and education, Kris applies this knowledge in her own life, teachings, writings, and her professional coaching practice. She is the creator of Spiritual Freedom Techniques, a series of processes that combine spiritual practices and principles with energy balancing for supercharged transformation. A former punk rocker, radio DJ, and performance artist, it was in healing her severe social anxiety that she was finally able to uncover her purpose and truly shine, without panic. In addition to writing and creating curricula on transformation, and producing a cutting-edge newsletter with original photography, she writes and performs spoken-word poetry and is an accomplished sculptor. When not traveling, she lives in Montclair, New Jersey, with her cats, Ling and the Baby Cheetah. Her first book, <span class="itali">Energy Healing: Simple &amp; Effective Practices to Become Your Own Healer</span><span class="itali">,</span><span class="itali"> </span>was a number-one bestseller on Amazon.
