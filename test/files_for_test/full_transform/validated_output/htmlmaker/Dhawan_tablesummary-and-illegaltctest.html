Among my mission was to help CEOs and organizations solve the practical challenges of managing across global, multi-generational, matrixed and virtual teams.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idznbu90tet">Everywhere I went, the same questions kept coming up: How do I keep my teams feeling connected to each other and to people on other teams? How do I help people of different ages and working styles who rarely meet in person communicate effectively? Why does it seem infinitely harder to foster trust, engagement, and the confidence to take risks? And finally, why do my own communications so often seem to miss the mark, with unintended and anxiety-producing consequences?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idqexb4tgk6">The more I worked with my clients to solve these problems, the more obvious it became that the problem was caused by the very digital tools that had set them free in so many ways. That our failure to grapple with the ways that the shiny new tools of the digital workplace&#x2014;email, text messaging, PowerPoint, Zoom&#x2014;changed communication, created widespread misunderstanding and conflict that manifested as across-the-board anxiety, fear, distrust and paranoia.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id6e2blsx3a">The good news is that this problem is eminently solvable, with some attention to a skill I call digital body language. I have taught many leaders how to model digital body language for their teams, and how to introduce it to their cultures, with remarkable results. I have trained managers, HR teams and coaches how to embed digital body language skills into their leadership programs. And I have advised everyone from doctors using telehealth to professors in online learning to lawyers, consultants and board directors in virtual boardrooms to master this skill. One leader told me that simple changes in digital body language not only transformed the way her entire organization communicates, but also the customer experience that she was able to provide even from afar. Another executive told me it changed how he connected with his wife and children while traveling for business.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idcg11vnz8k">Now it&#x2019;s time to show you how too.</p><p class="Blank-Space-BreakBsbrk" id="id8kphfjlbh">[blank]</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idqbeu38x24">When people ask me how I started doing what I do, I tell them it&#x2019;s a lifelong story.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id8z1kco5l7">As a first-generation American girl born to Indian parents, I came to English in an indirect way. I grew up in a middle-class neighborhood outside Pittsburgh. At home, my parents, both physicians who had immigrated to the U.S. in their 20s, spoke Punjabi, a language close to Hindi, and only rarely English. My mom and dad both placed a big priority on making sure my two siblings and I honored traditional Indian values and customs. Silence was a sign of respect to elders, and listening a prized trait. Learning English, doing well academically and almost everything else came in second.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iduvpvidpra">Growing up in a white, conservative, suburban part of the country, I spent a lot of my childhood trying to fit in. There weren&#x2019;t many girls who looked like me, or who were the children of immigrants, or who sat down for dinner every night at 9:00 PM. (Indian families tend to eat late.) At the same time, I felt almost no allegiance to India. Whenever I visited, my family there referred to me as &#x201C;the American-born cousin.&#x201D; Who in India was named <span class="itali">Erica</span>?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idatyxh7z1p">Caught between two cultures, I went inside myself.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idexx3vh3yc">Often you would hardly know I was there. In school I was shy, quiet, more an observer than a participant. Raising my hand or calling any attention to myself was unimaginable to me. I did well in school and on tests, but every report card from kindergarten to 12<span class="supersup">th</span> grade said the same thing: <span class="itali">I wish Erica spoke up more</span>.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idp7xenoiyi">As a girl pivoting between the thickly accented English of my parents and my own bad Hindi, and wanting to feel like I belonged <span class="itali">somewhere</span>, I developed a few tricks, and one of them was a talent for deciphering other people&#x2019;s body language. Body language offered the key to understanding the foreign worlds around me. I became obsessed with decoding my classmates&#x2019; signals and cues, no matter how subtle. Tone, pacing, pauses, gestures. The popular girls walked around with their heads high, shoulders pulled back, almost literally looking down on the rest of us. The older kids showed their disinterest by slouching during school assemblies, their eyes turned to the ground or each other&#x2014;never to the adult speaking. At home, I holed up in my room watching Bollywood movies on my family&#x2019;s old VCR, focusing less on the storyline (Hindi was still alien to me) and more on the actors&#x2019; faces and hands, rewinding over and over again, trying to understand what was being said by observing the actors&#x2019; non-verbal cues.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idytj2r7ezq">My preoccupation with translating what people convey non-verbally soon became a source of power as I learned to mimick the body language of my more confident peers and decode what my Hindi-speaking family members were saying to me with their furrowed brows.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idtic9d0v45">After September 11, virtually everyone who looked like me in America was suddenly clouded by instant suspicion in public spaces. One afternoon around that time, my father was waiting to pick me up at the local YMCA after tennis practice. Someone behind the front desk panicked&#x2014;my dad &#x201C;looked suspicious,&#x201D; I guess&#x2014;and called the police. For the next 45 minutes, my father fielded questions from the officers, politely explaining that he worked as a cardiologist at a nearby hospital. I looked on as he sat behind a table, speaking patiently with the officers, his eye contact direct, his palms wide open, signaling his respect to the officers and his understanding of why this was happening. I could also tell by his flushed cheeks that he was embarrassed. A few months later, my dad went even further, donating a significant percentage of his income that year to the 9/11 Fund.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idcoa199o41">I remember being angry at the police, but also at my father. How could he respond with kindness to what I saw as racial profiling and ignorance? Patiently, my father told my siblings and me that instead of responding with indignation or rage, wouldn&#x2019;t it be a better idea to consider what other people might be thinking and feeling? To put ourselves in <span class="itali">their</span> shoes? I can&#x2019;t be sure, but that was an inflection point for me, a day I began thinking harder about how humans convey empathy via body language, and what it could accomplish.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idvro0sv22j">My interest in nonverbal communication continued in college, where I read every book on the subject I could find, later calling on my growing expertise professionally when I began teaching public speaking. Being able to understand and classify cues and signals, along with the poise and confidence this skill gave me, helped me win internships and eventually, ridiculously competitive job opportunities. All of this in spite of my father insisting that Indian-Americans couldn&#x2019;t succeed in business, and that therefore I should focus on an occupation like medicine, or engineering, where Indians at least had a <span class="itali">tradition </span>of succeeding. But I persevered&#x2014;and it seemed to pay off.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id6s5p40y6n">My preoccupation with body language gave me the confidence to teach courses in leadership as a graduate student and, later, a teaching fellow at both Harvard and MIT. It motivated me to start my own business before I was 30, and scale it from a <span class="itali">what-if?</span> idea into a global company, despite having no clue what I was doing, or any media experience, investors or connections. Before I knew it, I was addressing global leaders at the World Economic Forum, getting interviewed by <span class="itali">Good Morning America</span><span class="itali"> </span>host Robin Roberts, and becoming a &#x201C;sought-after&#x201D; keynote speaker by CEOs and top executives, teaching 21<span class="supersup">st</span> century collaboration skills to thousands of leaders across a range of industries, companies and countries.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2a4r06usb">If it sounds like I&#x2019;m bragging, <span class="itali">please</span>! I hope it&#x2019;s clear by now that what I consider my &#x201C;expertise&#x201D; comes from shyer, humbler beginnings. There&#x2019;s a lot to be said for being withdrawn, never raising your hand in class and watching Bollywood movies alone in the dark after school. The point is, my whole life I&#x2019;ve believed, as many do, that the essence of empathy and trust isn&#x2019;t about <span class="itali">what </span>we say but <span class="itali">how</span> we say it, and how often we check ourselves to make sure that our words and their meanings are as deliberate and clear as possible. Studying my own and people&#x2019;s body language had taught me a lot through trial and error, in my case mostly error.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idnz2iubl7j">Hadn&#x2019;t my own experience taught me that poor posture and a dead-fish handshake made a negative impression on prospective employers? Hadn&#x2019;t one teacher told me that my habit of nervously twirling my hair signaled my insecurity? Hadn&#x2019;t I found out that a professor&#x2019;s tightly set lips, or the tensing of a nostril, signaled whether I had aced or blown a test or paper? As a speaker, didn&#x2019;t I know that the difference between success and failure was about intuiting what an audience wanted, and adjusting my message accordingly?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idfcnri5ckz">Once, early in my career, I delivered a keynote presentation in front of a big audience. It was the weekend, and the fourth day of an all-firm lawyer retreat. Not surprisingly, the audience was tired, peevish, disengaged and tuned out. Some people looked overtly hostile. Others were slumped in their chairs, heads hanging to the side, eyes glancing up at the clock. The last thing anyone wanted to hear about that day were the advantages of collaboration. Their body language almost begged me: <span class="itali">Not another framework, please.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idwzqa6m9iz">So I pivoted. Removing my heels, I took a seat on the edge of the stage, and scrapped my usual introduction. &#x201C;Talk about the two emotions you&#x2019;re feeling right now,&#x201D; I said. &#x201C;Fatigue, tension, boredom, anticipation, rage, you name it&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#x201D; Well, the mood in the room changed, like that. I was no longer talking <span class="itali">at</span> the audience; I was talking <span class="itali">with</span> them. Everyone started to loosen up, relax, smile, laugh. A speech that could have been a disaster turned into an interactive hour of genuine connection and animated discussion.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idr1qw04c3q">Over the next few years, I made it a point, as I do today, to suss out the body language of audiences. Blank expressions mean that I&#x2019;m going too fast and need to slow down. Crossed arms signal defensiveness or resentment. As for me, I know that gesturing or adjusting my hair too much signals my own lack of confidence.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2xv1dzdcr">This brings me to two years ago, when I started hearing one story after the next, all centering around the same theme: <span class="itali">miscommunication in the workplace.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idv08mjyyn1">As I said, I&#x2019;d been giving keynote speeches and consulting clients around the world, teaching people about how to collaborate better at work. The most common question in the Q&amp;A? How can we innovate faster and further by leveraging my experienced workforce that is comfortable in its ways, while capitalizing on the expertise of digitally fluent employees? And how can I get these two groups truly collaborating with each other? I began noticing that more and more clients and audience members of all ages were expressing high levels of fear, anxiety and paranoia about communication in their workplace. Leaders were doing what they&#x2019;d always done, e.g., sharing messages of support and trust with their colleagues and teams&#x2014;but more and more those messages were being misunderstood, misinterpreted or missed altogether. These people weren&#x2019;t dumb or lacking in social skills, and many were conversant in cutting edge work on how to build strong cultures.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id3jdrvt01b">As I dug more deeply, the biggest complaint seemed to be about how communications were being <span class="itali">translated </span>inside those same workplaces. That is, how a message that was meant to be friendly and to-the-point could be read by the recipient as angry or resentful, causing less engagement and innovation and even the loss of top performers.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idhpo9yc8eb">This issue was illustrated by a meeting I had with a client, a senior leader at Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idwk61hpisb">Kelci had gotten some tough feedback from her team around morale issues. In her review, her boss commented that Kelci&#x2019;s &#x201C;empathy was weak.&#x201D; When Kelci and I first met, and began talking, I kept my eye out for the standard, universal markers of subpar empathy: an inability to understand the needs of others; proficiency (or the lack of it) in reading and using body language; poor listening skills, a failure to ask deep questions. I was confused. Kelci was <span class="itali">fantastic</span> at all these things. She could make anybody feel at ease in a room, her body language signaled respect and understanding, and she listened deeply and carefully. What was going on?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idpwul27jlq">The answer had less to do with Kelci and more to do with today&#x2019;s tech-reliant workplace. Instead of being low in empathy, Kelci, like nearly everyone I counseled, didn&#x2019;t know what empathy <span class="itali">meant</span> anymore in a world where digital communication had made once-clear signals, cues and norms almost intelligible. A tone of voice? Approachable body language. Those things didn&#x2019;t cut it anymore. digital world required a <span class="itali">new</span> kind of body language. The problem was no one could agree on what it even <span class="itali">was.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id8n0so1dr2">For example, Kelci believed she was doing everyone a favor by keeping her emails brief. But her team found them cold and ambiguous. Kelci sent calendar invites at the last minute with no explanation, which made her teammates feel disrespected, as though Kelci&#x2019;s schedule mattered more than theirs. During strategy presentations, Kelci would glance down repeatedly at her phone, making others feel she was checked out.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ideed6u8d0x">Kelci&#x2019;s <span class="itali">digital</span> body language, then, was abysmal. It canceled out the very real clarity that comes when workplace colleagues (okay, humans in general) feel connected to one another.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idmnka8625m">I realized that our understanding of body language needed to be redefined for the contemporary workplace. Today we&#x2019;re all &#x201C;immigrants&#x201D; learning a new culture and language, except this time they&#x2019;re digital. Being a good leader today means not only being aware of the signals and cues other people send out, but mastering a new digital body language that didn&#x2019;t exist twenty years ago, and which most people today &#x201C;speak&#x201D; as badly as I spoke Hindi as a kid!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idu3m32lfmi">It was the world&#x2019;s dirty little secret: Some of the time&#x2014;<span class="itali">most </span>of the time&#x2014;people couldn&#x2019;t make heads or tails of the messages they were getting in emails, text messages, conference calls and so on. Nor were they entirely aware of how their own messages were being received. More than just a glitch, or a nuisance&#x2014;<span class="itali">technology is such a </span><span class="itali">pain</span>!&#x2014;it was causing serious issues. Work and decision-making had slowed. Teams were in disarray. Employees were left unmotivated, distrustful, uncertain and paranoid.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idu8iju58lr">It seemed that &#x201C;digital body language&#x201D;&#x2014;or rather, the lack of a set of universally agreed-upon rules&#x2014;was creating big problems across the globe&#x2014;in workplaces, communities and even families. Everyone knew about them, but no one talked about them, except anecdotally. There was no rulebook either. We had all grown up knowing how to read and write, some of us better than others (says the girl who remembers the day in school when reading aloud from George Orwell&#x2019;s <span class="itali">Animal Farm</span> in class, she pronounced the word &#x201C;peculiar&#x201D; as &#x201C;Peck-You-Liar,&#x201D; which her classmates never let her forget), but there was no instruction manual about how to read signals and cues in a digitized world. Instead, people at work were squandering hours or even days sunk in uncertainty, anxiety and disquiet.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddvgac83yr">I was hardly a Jedi-master at all this either. I&#x2019;d wasted entire mornings endlessly re-reading a single email, trying to figure out what an ellipsis or the word, <span class="itali">Thoughts</span>? meant. I&#x2019;d heard about friendships imploding over a WhatsApp conversation. What about the &#x201C;Like&#x201D; on Facebook or Instagram from a colleague who hadn&#x2019;t returned your two recent phone calls. (Did it signal &#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry&#x201D;? Was it a prelude to calling you back, a way of testing the friendship waters? Or was it a signal that from now on, you and that person would now be communicating exclusively via social media? What did it all <span class="itali">mean</span>? Something? Nothing?) What about the executive who signs off every email with &#x201C;Thank you.&#x201D;&#x2014;doesn&#x2019;t <span class="itali">that</span> show clarity? On the face of it, sure&#x2014;so why does it come across to his colleagues as insincere and inauthentic?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idy9pzmua1o">I genuinely believe most people have good intentions. They just may not know how to <span class="itali">convey </span>those intentions.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idtqiwv5wgj">How can we re-learn how to establish genuine trust and connection, no matter the distance? By creating a nuts-and-bolts rulebook for clear communications in the modern digital world. Communicating what we really mean today requires that we understand today&#x2019;s signals and cues at a granular level, while developing a heightened sensitivity to words, nuance, subtext, humor and punctuation that we mostly think of as the field of operations for professional writers.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idzvl2ivg5f">But if you think writing clearly is a niche or inessential skill, think again. When asked what the best investment professionals could make in their careers, Julie Sweet, global CEO of Accenture, answered, &#x201C;Develop excellent communication skills.&#x201D;<span class="EndnoteReference"><span class="endnotereference" id="endnoteref_1">1</span></span> Sweet added that any employee, even a junior-level one, could significantly heighten their value by &#x201C;articulately summarize (ing) a meeting&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. put (ting) together a presentation and (sending) emails that are really salient and to the point.&#x201D;<span class="EndnoteReference"><span class="endnotereference" id="endnoteref_2">2</span></span> Much has been said about developing top-of-the-line presentation and public speaking skills, but Julie Sweet has seen the future, one in which a supposedly &#x201C;soft&#x201D; skill&#x2014;communicating well, especially in your writing&#x2014;is a critical competitive advantage.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id5lt6ec670">What does good digital body language look like in action? It means never assuming that our own digital habits (e.g., answering every email we get within 3o seconds, or never listening to our voicemails) are shared by everybody else. It means taking a few extra seconds to ask yourself whether our sentences, words or even punctuation might be misinterpreted. It means being hyper-conscious of the signals and cues we send out, constantly checking in with ourselves, and learning along the way.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idtfit4yb7b">The book you&#x2019;re holding in your hands decodes the signals and cues of who gets heard, who gets credit and what gets done in our ever changing world. It will serve as a commonsense playbook that will help you understand how to communicate your ideas, negotiate relationships, speak your truth and build trust and confidence with people very different from you. the pages ahead, I will introduce simple strategies to help you and your teams understand eachother and banish the confusion, frustration and misunderstandings that arise from email, video, instant messaging and even live meetings. My mission is to help you get closer to anyone&#x2014;intellectually, emotionally, personally, professionally&#x2014;and make yourself stand out as a trusted, straightforward leader, no matter the distance.</p><p class="Section-PartSPT" id="idwq31hnv28">Part One: Digital Elements of Style</p><p class="NumberNum" id="idap6694c7s">Part One</p><p class="TitleTtl" id="id4enz9olty">Digital Elements of Style</p><p class="Section-ChapterSCP" id="ididv49ym53">Chapter 1: What <span class="itali">Is</span> Digital Body Language?</p><p class="NumberNum" id="id5149zs4pc">Chapter 1</p><p class="TitleTtl" id="iduykxnoz0i">What <span class="itali">Is</span> Digital Body Language?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idkffoftmmo">They had been going out for three years when the fight occurred, conducted exclusively via text-message.

In 1991, Tannen, a professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, published her book, <span class="itali">You Just Don&#x2019;t Understand: Women and Men in Conversation. </span>I wasn&#x2019;t the only one; <span class="itali">everyone</span> seemed to be reading Deb Tannen&#x2019;s book. An analysis of how we talk to one another using indirection, interruption, pauses, humor and pacing, <span class="itali">You Just Don&#x2019;t Understand</span> dominated national conversations, spent four years on the <span class="itali">New York Times</span> bestseller list and was translated into thirty languages.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idtnkw1sk7o">None of us need a linguistics degree to know that the ways we communicate meaning today are more confusing than ever. Why? Well, Tannen studied body language almost exclusively in face-to-face interactions. Her work was informed by linguistics, gender and evolutionary biology, but also on what you and I convey whenever we cross our arms, look away or blink. None of us, including Tannen, could have predicted that today, the majority of our connections would be virtual<span class="itali">.</span> Contemporary speech relies more than ever on <span class="itali">how</span> we say something rather than on <span class="itali">what</span> we say. That is, our <span class="itali">digital body language</span>. When the internet came along, everyone was given a dais and a microphone, but no one was told how to use them. We all just picked things up as we went along. And the mistakes we&#x2019;ve made along the way have had real consequences in business.</p><p class="Display1Disp1" id="idcl9zwmdxk"><span class="boldb">You see, these days, we don&#x2019;t talk the talk </span><span class="boldb">or</span><span class="boldb"> even walk the talk.

What&#x2019;s more, each of us has different expectations and instincts about whether we should send a text versus an email, when to look in the camera in a video call, how long to wait before we write someone back, and how to write a digital thank you or apology without seeming sloppy or insincere. Our word choices, response times, video meeting styles and the way we sign off emails and even our email signatures, create impressions that can either enhance or wreck our closest relationships in the workplace (not to mention in our personal lives).</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idu2m8erbd9">Today, roughly 70 percent of all communication among teams is virtual.

Not gonna lie-I&#x2019;m guilty too!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id6f33stylp">More data: the <span class="itali">New York Times</span> reports that 43 percent of working Americans spend at least some time working remotely,.<span class="EndnoteReference"><span class="endnotereference" id="endnoteref_5">5</span></span> a percentage that skyrocketed to almost 100 percent during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Emotional Intelligence, or EI, refers to our ability to read other people&#x2019;s signals and respond to them appropriately, while understanding and appreciating the world from others&#x2019; perspective.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idm4vpnets8">Today, emotional intelligence and empathy have become buzzwords. They are spoken about at roundtables. They are part of every mainstream education curriculum. They show up in value statements across every industry&#x2014;from professional services to healthcare to technology. And they are trademark words in political campaigns, and media conversations. Leaders have sold us on the idea that seeing situations clearly from others&#x2019; perspectives can transform leadership styles, work cultures and business strategies. Empathy, it seems, advances morale, triggers innovation and produces both profits and learning, engagement and retention. Surely everyone can agree we need more empathy in the world.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id8a2wnzbya">Why, then, are we all facing a crisis of misunderstanding at work?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id6x0hhk7t3">Well, a big problem is that reading emotion and the digital nature of the modern workplace are a mismatch.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id4o3ewh2uc">When emotional intelligence came to stage, the digital era was in its infancy. Email was a barely unwrapped toy. Smart phones, if they existed, were concrete slabs and rarely appeared at meetings. Texting was what European teenagers did. And video calls were foreign species. Today, many organizations and communities exist exclusively behind a screen. We&#x2019;ve shifted the way we create connections and, consequently, how we work with our colleagues as well as our customers, community members or audiences.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idz3umcgs29">The loss of non-verbal body cues is among the most undervalued and well-concealed reasons why employees feel so disengaged from others. If used properly, and at scale, empathetic body language equals employee engagement. Disengagement happens not because people don&#x2019;t <span class="itali">want</span> to be empathetic, but because with today&#x2019;s tools, they don&#x2019;t know <span class="itali">how</span>. Yes a CEO can say, &#x201C;My office door is always open,&#x201D; and tell everyone he&#x2019;s &#x201C;accessible&#x201D; and &#x201C;approachable.&#x201D; But what if he&#x2019;s never actually <span class="itali">in</span> the office, and the only way to communicate with him is to jump into his daily queue of 200+ daily emails or Slack messages?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idl546zuqed">Most of today&#x2019;s workplaces, in fact, <span class="itali">minimize</span> the conditions necessary to foster and augment clear communication, leading to widespread distrust, resentment, and frustration. There are more far-flung teams. There are fewer face-to-face interactions. There is virtually no body language to read. Plus, every few months things seem to get <span class="itali">faster</span> (or maybe we&#x2019;re all just imagining it), leaving us no choice but to adapt to the newest normal. We become more thoughtlessly efficient. We grow more accepting of distractions and interruptions, more indifferent to the needs and emotions of colleagues and workmates. This digital disconnect leads us to misinterpret, overlook or ignore signals and cues, creating entirely <span class="itali">new</span> waves of organizational dysfunction.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idisxsgjvw7">The question is, <span class="itali">why</span>?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id4zbu7cib0"><span class="boldb">We are cue-less</span>. It&#x2019;s worth repeating: non-verbal cues make up 60 to 80 percent of face-to-face communication.<span class="EndnoteReference"><span class="endnotereference" id="endnoteref_9">9</span></span> Anthropologist Edward T. Hall called these signals and cues&#x2014;posture, proximity, smiles, pauses, yawns, tone, facial expressions, eye contact, hand gestures and how loudly or quietly we speak&#x2014;&#x201C;the<span class="itali"> </span>silent language.&#x201D;</p><p class="Display2Disp2" id="idhdzq9g48k"><span class="bold-italbi">How</span><span class="bold-italbi"> do we create connection when</span><span class="bold-italbi"> up to 70 percent of communication among teams takes place digitally?</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id69z7y0qz5"><span class="boldb">Our ability to care is compromised.</span> Remember how a handshake after a job well done used to go a long way toward making you feel valued? Today, when team members work in different spheres, departments, offices and countries, a handshake is impossible. One research study inserted very small delays into video calls to assess how colleagues judged one another. For delays of only 1.2 seconds, people would most likely be rated as less attentive, friendly, and self-disciplined than if there was no delay.<span class="EndnoteReference"><span class="endnotereference" id="endnoteref_10">10</span></span> Even on video chats, a screen freezing or that weird echo from your colleague makes it hard for attendees to feel valued, leaving us with the question:</p><p class="Display2Disp2" id="idevv41e9n6"><span class="bold-italbi">How do we show appreciation nowadays</span><span class="boldb">?</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idnubxjgqtj"><span class="boldb">Our timing is off.</span> When someone standing two feet away asks us a question, we respond instantly. We also know when a conversation has come to a natural end. But today, we are no longer obliged to respond to someone immediately (we have stuff to do!). At the same time, responding to your employees&#x2019; or your clients&#x2019; &#x201C;urgent&#x201D; texts five hours later may leave them feeling ignored and resentful.</p><p class="Display2Disp2" id="idfhf81hu9y"><span class="bold-italbi">How can we find the balance between busy inboxes and response times that convey respect?</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idzvx3dz8qk"><span class="boldb">Our screens have altered our traditional body language.</span> When we glance down at our phones or answer &#x201C;quick&#x201D; texts during a business meeting, 1:1 or lunch discussion, we tend to lose track of our surroundings. We wrap up meetings faster than we should, overlook the look in a colleague&#x2019;s eyes, his smiles, or the fact he just put down his pen to listen more closely. In sales conversations, it&#x2019;s even easy to miss the lean in.</p><p class="Display2Disp2" id="idinr4bz77q"><span class="bold-italbi">How do we stop digital tools from interrupting even our face-to-face interactions?</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id5b7i66s2l">Lastly, as we all know, <span class="boldb">T</span><span class="boldb">echnology creates masks</span>. Today, we all have the option of concealing what we really feel and think. Choosing to email or text can cloak uncomfortable feelings&#x2014;but it can also create a whole lot of ambiguity and misunderstanding. For people who like to keep their thoughts and feelings to themselves, performing behind screens is good camouflage. But that&#x2019;s not how leaders are built. Even when you&#x2019;re on a video conference, gazing back at your own face on the screen makes it harder for you to relax fully and naturally into the conversation.</p><p class="Display2Disp2" id="idcesmmuu5r"><span class="bold-italbi">How can we remain authentic and connected when a screen divides us?</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2ikcyec6k">The answer is understanding the cues and signals that we&#x2019;re sending with our <span class="boldb">digital body language</span> and tailoring them to create clear, precise messages.</p><p class="Display1Disp1" id="id0pfhmqw5j"><span class="boldb">What is </span><span class="bold-italbi">implicit</span><span class="boldb"> in body language now has to be </span><span class="bold-italbi">explicit</span><span class="boldb"> in the way we communicate.</span></p><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="id04y9mcvga">What is Digital Body Language (and why is it important?)</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idqxtfnoigj"><span class="itali">Digital Body Language</span> offers a systematic approach to understanding the signs of the digital world much as we do those of the physical world.

Value Visibly means we understand that reading the emails in our inbox with care and attention is the new art of listening. When we Value Visibly, we&#x2019;re willing to sit with others&#x2019; discomfort without feeling we have to fix or resolve it. Value Visibly means recognizing other people&#x2014;and not being in a hurry about it, either.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idj9fyh51s3">Inevitably, Value Visibly leads to greater levels of respect and trust. I recall a time that I tried to schedule a phone call with a senior executive who had expressed intertest in working with me. Over the next five months, she re-scheduled the call three times. No, wait, she didn&#x2019;t cancel, <span class="itali">she just didn&#x2019;t show up</span>. After the first no-show, I sent a follow-up email, and her assistant rescheduled our call. (There was no &#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry&#x201D; from the executive, or even a madcap excuse.) The second time she didn&#x2019;t show up, her assistant apologized and again rescheduled. The third time, there was nothing, just dead air. A few months later, this same executive emailed me, as if nothing between us had happened, for advice on how to join a club of which I was a member. This time it was <span class="itali">my</span> turn not to reply,</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idsubw0dkj4">It felt cathartic.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idf6yuwhnea">By &#x201C;respect,&#x201D; I&#x2019;m not talking about niceties or apologies. Respect means that others feel appropriately valued, included or acknowledged. Respect means you proofread your email before sending it. Respect means you honor other people&#x2019;s time, and schedules, and <span class="itali">don&#x2019;</span><span class="itali">t </span>cancel meetings at the last second, or delay your response to an email so long that people have to chase you down. Respect means not<span class="itali"> </span>using the Mute button during a conference call to attend to five other things as someone is talking. Respect means writing clear subject lines in meeting invitations that explain exactly why you are requesting another person&#x2019;s time. (At a minimum, respect is about spelling that person&#x2019;s name right!)</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idcsk9xx9ea">Value Visibly also means acknowledging that solutions that work in one context may not in others. Imagine you&#x2019;ve just pulled an all-nighter on a project, sent it and your boss responds with &#x201C;<span class="itali">ty</span>&#x201D; or &#x201C;<span class="itali">tx</span>.&#x201D; It&#x2019;s not enough, right? In fact, it&#x2019;s enraging. Now, imagine handing this same project to your boss in person, and getting a smile and a &#x201C;thank you.&#x201D; You&#x2019;d feel better. Value Visibly<span class="boldb"> </span>is about making the time and effort to communicate the equivalent of a smile or &#x201C;thank you&#x201D; across digital channels.</p><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="idgfgyh68bt">Communicate Carefully</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ideldpbc5sn"><span class="boldb">Communicate Carefully</span> means making a continuous effort to minimize the risk for misunderstanding and misinterpretation by being as clear as possible in your words and digital body language. We Communicate Carefully when we establish unambiguous expectations and norms about which channels we use, what we include in our messages, and who we include on the recipient list. We Communicate Carefully when we know why each person copied on the message is accountable, and who is responsible for the next steps.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idnnz2dai9p">Communicating Carefully goes a long way toward eliminating confusion. Communicating Carefully allows for a consistent understanding of each team member&#x2019;s requirements and needs, helping to streamline communication and reduce inefficiencies in teamwork. Finally, Communicating Carefully leads to alignment.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idyy5n00az9">Has the following ever happened to you? You and your team have been working hard to initiate a great new idea. When it&#x2019;s ready to go, everyone is exhausted but exhilarated. It&#x2019;s time to reap the rewards for all that hard work! At which point company lawyers step in, ask a few questions and either kill the project or disable it enough so it&#x2019;s no longer recognizable.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idacryaicp6">Or what about the marketing team at a professional services firm that spends months on a new product offering only then to realize that another operations team has already created the exact same thing a year before?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idmhrnp7kw3">Or how about the team that can&#x2019;t agree on whether a project was a success or a failure because they never agreed on the metrics of success?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idn2jss723h">Regardless of the scenario, time is wasted, energy is sapped, and the workplace mood shifts from buoyant to discouraged. Why did no one realize this was an issue? Answer? There was no clear communication between silos. The legal team wasn&#x2019;t brought in until the last second. The compliance officers had no say during the planning stages. Customers were not listened to. The marketing and accounting leads never got together and said, <span class="itali">Here</span><span class="itali"> is what I want, here is what I think, let&#x2019;s get on the same page.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idom3y40ajm">Communicate Carefully means that people have to agree whether or not a given project is necessary, and in sync with the organization. Communicate Carefully means keeping employees and teams informed and up-to-date, and then checking in constantly to support their efforts. Who is working on what, and why? Personally, I&#x2019;ve lost count of the number of times team members jump into projects without taking ten minutes to consider the principals involved, only to find out three months later that another team has been doing the <span class="itali">exact same work.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iducustqgh2">But the biggest impediment to alignment is lack of clarity. Communicating Carefully restores that alignment through digital body language signals and cues&#x2014;from realizing that a &#x201C;brief&#x201D; message is not always a &#x201C;clear&#x201D; one, to eliminating tone-deaf language, to everything in between.</p><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="idrqd52yyj1">Collaborate Confidently</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ids63md3b91">The third pillar, <span class="boldb">Collaborate Confidently,</span> is about the freedom to take conscious risks while trusting that others will support your decisions.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idkdbt7lp9n">Collaborating Confidently means managing the fear, uncertainty and worry that defines modern workplaces&#x2014;and understanding that even when things get crazy, employees are there to support one another, and won&#x2019;t allow any one person to go down with the ship.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idylg42ui90">Collaborating Confidently means people are empowered to respond with care and patience, instead of buying into the belief that a 24/7 workplace means we have to respond to everything immediately.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id5pmtiy1wj">Collaborating Confidently means we prioritize thoughtfulness, while reducing groupthink behavior. What does that look like? Well, it might mean a live meeting that&#x2019;s moderated by the one remote member on the team, creating a sense of inclusion, and also reducing the bias we tend to have toward teammates who are physically present in the room. It might mean using the virtual chat tool in a video meeting to collect team opinions in writing first and then calling on people with different ideas to speak up, instead of listening to the loudest people who agree with one another first. It might mean designing a structure for work requests in email, so that no one is left speculating wildly about the meaning of an email that ends with the letter &#x201C;<span class="itali">K</span>.&#x201D; It might even mean something as straightforward as making sure that team members always have what they need to move forward.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idovtcqa251">Collaborating Confidently decreases the chances you get stuck in the trap of being simultaneously <span class="itali">over</span>-attentive and <span class="itali">under</span>-attentive, e.g. those times you obsess over minor stuff in one email while racing through others, while overlooking important details.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idd9lpom5u8">Collaborating Confidently frees us up to overcome our habitual fears and uncertainties and move forward to <span class="itali">action.</span> It allows us to quit obsessing over, &#x201C;Did she really mean this?&#x201D; and &#x201C;Is he angry at me but just isn&#x2019;t saying so?&#x201D; and &#x201C;Are they giving me the runaround?&#x201D; Instead, we assume the best intent from others, knowing that no one will succeed at someone else&#x2019;s cost, or by misdirection, or by forcing the upper hand.</p><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="ida6ron0xlh">Trust Totally</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idlbmoeaaok">The fourth and final law of digital body language, <span class="boldb">Trust Totally</span>, happens only after the first three laws have been implemented, yielding 360-degree engagement. The &#x201C;Totally&#x201D; part of Trust Totally is key, since it implies the highest levels of organizational faith, where people tell the truth, keep their word and deliver on their commitments.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idav3topaaj">Trusting Totally means you have an open team culture, where everyone knows they are listened to, can always ask one another for help, and grant favors whose returns may or may not be immediate. Once the first three laws of digital body language are in place, leading to Trusting Totally, congratulations! You&#x2019;ve broken the stranglehold of fear and uncertainty in your organization and are on your way to assembling the always-elusive perfect team.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id16v1ixq3u">Why? Because when we Trust Totally, we get the most out of people. By creating psychological safety on our teams (beginning with our leaders&#x2019; own digital body language), our actions create trickle-down calm. Once trust exists, anything that helps support it is prioritized, and everything impeding or distracting from it is addressed and dealt with.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id8vx0xnk5h">But let&#x2019;s be clear: Trust Totally doesn&#x2019;t mean we extend unconditional trust to <span class="itali">everyone</span>&#x2014;especially people with whom we&#x2019;ve had negative or unresolved experiences in the past. Instead, Trust Totally refers to a workplace environment where no one wastes time sweating the small stuff. One where an ambiguously worded message or late-to-arrive response doesn&#x2019;t automatically give rise to fear, anxiety or insecurity. One where we confidently assume everyone is on our side. This is a pretty big ask these days, but Trust Totally <span class="itali">works</span>.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idqeo1x12c5">Over the years I&#x2019;ve worked with some truly egregious people. I once worked for a boss who invaded my every waking moment. She began drilling my inbox with emails at 9PM, usually when I was in the supermarket, pushing around a cart at the end of a long workday. If I didn&#x2019;t reply after five minutes, the urgent texts would begin: <span class="itali">I need the report on the Chicago meeting! Did you finish? Where is it?</span> I would surrender my half-filled cart, run home, work late, get it off to her by midnight and fall asleep. At 6AM, I would wake up to a new text, under the guise of &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s chat this morning to review the report.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idu5xiemce3">Clearly this was one case where Trust Totally was impossible. I did <span class="itali">not</span> feel Valued Visibly; my boss&#x2019;s messages were <span class="itali">not</span> Communicated Carefully; and we were decidedly <span class="itali">not</span> Collaborating Confidently. In the years since, I&#x2019;ve found that when a foundation of Trust Totally exists, people are much more willing to say what they mean fearing criticism or reprisal and, if necessary, come up with substantive improvements, even in tough situations (like with my old boss). Trusting Totally can help transform a passive-aggressive or dominating colleague from an obnoxious pill to, believe it or not, a decent person.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idtk9d1rfw7">Finally, Trusting Totally leads to empowerment. Yes, I know, <span class="itali">empower</span> and <span class="itali">empowerment </span>are so overused they&#x2019;ve become meaningless. So often leaders tell teams, &#x201C;I want to empower you,&#x201D; but aren&#x2019;t willing to give up even a sliver of control to allow other voices to contribute. So, the concept can&#x2019;t help but ring a little false. But in the context of Trust Totally, empowerment means giving people full ownership of their work, as well as the resources they need to finish it.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idls0rljlf3">Empowerment means everyone feels safe to speak up, introduce a controversial perspective or simply say, &#x201C;This isn&#x2019;t working for me,&#x201D; without fearing they&#x2019;ve created new enemies. Empowerment implies high levels of psychological safety, information flows, candid discussions about how comfortable people are with failure&#x2014;and clear ways forward that embed respect, alignment and action across the workplace.</p><p class="Blank-Space-BreakBsbrk" id="idcyong0nwz">[blank]</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idtq6spbci4"><span class="itali">Digital Body Language</span> is for people whose bosses and colleagues drone on and on about teamwork, but never seem to do what&#x2019;s necessary to facilitate it.

Value Visibly means being more sensitive to other people&#x2019;s time and needs, reading digital communications with care and attention, and respecting other people&#x2014;without being in a rush about it, either.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1nqzbza30">I&#x2019;ll call him Jim. I was in New York City, and he was in Dallas. I had just started my own consulting business, and Jim was just beginning his post-college career. During our video interview, he responded quickly and intelligently to my questions. He seemed interested in the work I was doing on collaboration, and he was a good communicator, too. Eager to get started, I hired him on the spot as my new marketing strategist.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idbbwaywvke">I chose right, too&#x2014;Jim was a fantastic employee. I loved what a self-starter he was, and how little oversight he needed. As I rushed forward in my business, he always matched my pace, finishing whatever administrative tasks I texted or emailed him without requiring much guidance. Whenever I sent him a work request, Jim&#x2019;s usual email quick response, &#x201C;Sounds good,&#x201D; gave me confidence he had everything under control. (And my typical &#x2018;Thx&#x2019; response made me feel like he knew I appreciated it.)</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id5xh4fmh3n">Fast-forward to our phone check-in six weeks later:</p><p class="Extract1Ext1" id="id5irmnrbuo">Me: So, how do you think it&#x2019;s going? Because I think it&#x2019;s going really well!</p><p class="Extract1Ext1" id="id5uyot6btz">Jim: No, it&#x2019;s not.</p><p class="Extract1Ext1" id="idpn7tu81oa">Me: No, it&#x2019;s not? Wait, what?</p><p class="Extract1Ext1" id="idj62khoudd">Jim: No, it&#x2019;s not going well and I&#x2019;m thinking of quitting. Today.</p><p class="Extract1Ext1" id="id9sfxv9khu">Me: Today? Wait, sorry, <span class="itali">what</span>?</p><p class="Extract1Ext1" id="idlwem27o7m">Jim: Look, I have my Masters Degree, and I don&#x2019;t want to do only admin work. I thought I would be handed a lot more marketing. Like we discussed in our original interview? And we barely talk about what you&#x2019;re working on and the larger picture of the business.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idv8okh3tnd">It turns out that as I was busy powering forward, for the most part relying only on weekly phone check-ins, Jim was sitting there in Dallas, stewing, uncertain about how he was doing in his job and&#x2014;even more importantly for a young professional&#x2014;not knowing exactly <span class="itali">why</span> he was doing it. His &#x201C;Sounds good&#x201D; emails didn&#x2019;t signal, &#x201C;I will take this on happily.&#x201D; They were code for, &#x201C;I will do this begrudgingly but I really want to talk about my learning goals too.&#x201D; My &#x201C;Thx&#x201D; emails, intended to communicate, &#x201C;I really appreciate your hard work&#x201D; were interpreted by Jim as dismissive. I thought I was being explicit, but in the end, Jim felt both underappreciated and disrespected.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idxc7uemeeu">Was I an inexperienced leader at the time? Absolutely. If Jim and I had shared an office, would I have treated him in the same way? There&#x2019;s no way. Looking back, I realized I&#x2019;d showed Jim a lot of disrespect. I was always 8&#x2013;10 minutes late to our weekly calls, wasting his time and angering him with every additional &#x201C;sry running late&#x201D; email. Sometimes I ended our phone conversations to take another call without first explaining why I needed to answer the second one right away. By the time I turned my attention back to him, both of us had lost our train of thought, forcing us to waste even more time picking up the flow of our discussion. Lastly, and most embarrassingly, I would send incomplete emails, responding to <span class="itali">some</span> of Jim&#x2019;s questions but not all, since I was otherwise busy prioritizing more urgent tasks.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id22iibk1vp">Jim was right to advocate for himself, and to be honest. He also offered me a chance for redemption. Our resulting conversation, as uncomfortable as it was, reminded me how important it is to <span class="boldb">Value Visibly</span>, to consciously, outwardly show respect toward people in our professional and personal lives.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id6s47fxxbs">Over half of all employees report they don&#x2019;t receive the respect they need or want from their leaders.<span class="EndnoteReference"><span class="endnotereference" id="endnoteref_11">11</span></span> That sounds like a whole lot of ungrateful leaders! But could there be another explanation? What if those leaders are expressing respect in ways that some employees don&#x2019;t recognize? As the signs of respect have changed, so, too, have the skills we need to use to make our colleagues feel valued.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idrypzkhhap">Traditional respect has always been based on signals we share in person. Each personal interaction generated positive signals that our brains understand unconsciously after hundreds of thousands of years of evolutionary training. But today, as I note throughout this book, many of our interactions lack visible cues of meaning and understanding.</p><p class="Display1Disp1" id="id70jb053ml"><span class="boldb">When relationships are mediated by screens, how do we make the invisible visible?</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idw24au94hh">After talking to Jim, I realized I was making a mistake that is also one of the greatest killers of engagement today: I assumed that if I didn&#x2019;t hear anything from Jim, everything was okay. (&#x201C;No news is good news,&#x201D; as the saying goes, even though that&#x2019;s no way to run a business.). With up to 60 percent of teamwork today conducted digitally and via the written word, we can no longer rely on assumptions to gauge feelings of mutual respect.<span class="EndnoteReference"><span class="endnotereference" id="endnoteref_12">12</span></span> My lack of face-to-face interaction with Jim meant I was missing out on a lot of important information. I had to move from relying on a single conversation per project to multiple touchpoints and from <span class="itali">unstated</span> appreciation to<span class="itali"> stated</span> recognition.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idkeo5gqjwo">After our conversation, I made sure to end previous meetings on time to avoid causing delays. Jim and I scheduled weekly video check-ins to review work and ensure he felt valued and supported. The video format gave me an opportunity to read Jim&#x2019;s body cues so I could observe firsthand what made him uncomfortable, and the times he seemed unable to express himself in words or needed more time to reflect on something. Well, &#x201C;sitting&#x201D; with someone without rushing back and forth via email solved our communication challenges pretty quickly. We also had the opportunity to discuss Jim&#x2019;s professional learning goals, ultimately creating a project that he would complete in conjunction with his other responsibilities.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idpf8xtblff">In general, I got better (<span class="itali">a lot</span> better) at checking in with Jim, giving him feedback on his contributions, and expressing appreciation for his hard work. End result? Eventually, Jim and I worked together for years. And the lessons I learned still guide me.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idzyx1ys1o4">Today I leverage digital tools like video calls and weekly or bi-weekly email &#x201C;check-ins&#x201D; to ensure that my team feels Valued Visibly. For each person, I choose a communication medium based on his or her personality style (e.g., my college interns communicate best on Slack and enjoy emailed Amazon gift cards at the end of their tenures, while my executive team sticks to emails and appreciate personalized notes), while making sure I express encouragement or gratitude as often as possible. I don&#x2019;t leave messages unanswered and when meeting with my team, I don&#x2019;t allow myself any other digital distractions.</p><p class="Display1Disp1" id="iddk2deit31"><span class="boldb">Value Visibly means not assuming people are &#x201C;okay.&#x201D; Instead, be proactive about explicitly showing you understand their desires and </span><span class="boldb">value their participation.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id7x0vibyju">As my experience with Jim shows, respect enables leaders to challenge a situation, not a person, and creates an environment where team members feel valued to engage in healthy, and even heated, conversations. Respect facilitates innovation and creativity by allowing leaders to tap into the power of diverse thinking and multiple perspectives. On the other hand, disrespect (whether intended or not) is the silent killer of collaboration, initiative, and job satisfaction.</p><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="idocg4gmy6b">Stop Disrespecting Me!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id7v15gwfee">In the middle of doing research for this book, I got a frantic phone call from a client. The head of human resources needed a favor. <span class="itali">Fast.</span> One of the company&#x2019;s leaders was managing a high-profile project and was having trouble keeping teams up and running. It was a start-up of sorts, so people were expected to work long hours based on the expectation of future equity. But the teams were <span class="itali">not</span> collaborating, and communication was at a standstill. Everyone felt it too, which was affecting morale as well as speed to market and customer deadlines. Could I help?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idqlfko5dgp">Of course! I said, adding that even though I was on a research sabbatical, I would be happy to speak with the executive and create an action plan. The executive and I had a long, informative discussion during which we talked through some solutions. At the end of the conversation, he seemed eager to get moving and asked me to send him a proposal within a week<span class="boldb">, </span>and to plan to start working together within three weeks. Of course, I said. Working late for the next few nights, I delivered the proposal on deadline.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idadmr3p5ks">Then&#x2014;nothing. I never heard from him again. I later met other consultants who&#x2019;d had the same experience of getting caught up in an enthusiastic conversation with this same person and then, after delivering the promised work, getting ghosted. I could only guess that he treated all his teams the same way&#x2014;with a total lack of respect for their time and expertise.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idwqew90vzc">Value Visibly is easy to preach but a lot harder to embed in the modern workplace. There is no shortage of articles talking about establishing respect by building a code of ethics or remembering to greet people in the elevator&#x2014;but how does that translate to emails, IMs, and conference calls? The inherently distant nature of these communication channels makes disrespectful behaviors easy&#x2014;even in live meetings.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idn94yvhhbk">I&#x2019;ll never forget a meeting I once had with Anilu, a senior executive at a large company. It took five emails, two follow-ups and one confirmation call with her assistant to find a time that fit her calendar. I showed up at the appointed time. Nearly ten minutes later, Anilu walked into the room, greeted me, and immediately said, &#x201C;You picked the worst time for this meeting. I have a big interview I have to give later today.&#x201D; I offered to reschedule, but instead, Anilu asked her colleague to come in and take her place in the meeting while she stayed there prepping for her next meeting on her phone.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idhy4vf7vpe">The whole situation was bizarre. I felt more disrespected by Anilu sitting in the room on her phone than I would have if she had just excused herself and allowed her colleague to take the meeting. I couldn&#x2019;t help but be reminded of the great employee I had once almost lost, Jim. That feeling of being undervalued and disrespected stays with you. Why would I ever recommend Anilu to anyone in my own network? Who knows how many great opportunities she&#x2019;s lost over the years as a result of treating others so poorly?</p><p class="Custom1Cust1" id="idqyss2cefy"><span class="boldb">#EricaTips</span></p><p class="BOX-BBOX-B" id="id0g5wdaabl">BOX-B</p><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="id0e9ihxr7p">Common Pet Peeves You Must Avoid:</p><p class="Bullet-Level-1-ListBl1" id="ide4e4gnens"><span class="boldb">-</span><span class="boldb">Being in a rush.</span> Sending a message without proofreading.

Instead of listening as others share their ideas, we read what they have to say in an email or on another digital medium. The problem, according to research done by linguist Naomi Baron, is that we comprehend less when reading on a screen than we do reading print.<span class="EndnoteReference"><span class="endnotereference" id="endnoteref_13">13</span></span> We devote less time to reading the passage onscreen, are more prone to multitasking, and tend to skim and search instead of reading slowly and carefully.<span class="EndnoteReference"><span class="endnotereference" id="endnoteref_14">14</span></span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id8snpgf1xe">For example, here&#x2019;s a recent email exchange I had with a client:</p><p class="Image-PlacementImg" id="idn9op7xio1">16-yesresponse.pdf</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id6stznrqjw">It left me speechless.

Instead of taking the time to go carefully through messages, we race through them toward an indeterminate finish line (one that resets every morning). Our need for speed leads to exchanges like the one above&#x2014;the digital equivalent of talking over each other.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2kjotbdsq">But are we <span class="itali">really</span> as busy as we think we are? According to Baron, we&#x2019;re just&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. not. A lot of our speed, and our anxiety around speed, is artificial and ends up costing us accuracy, clarity and respect. But even if you really <span class="itali">are</span> too busy to get back to people immediately, there are ways to show you aren&#x2019;t blowing them off. You can show respect, for example, by sending a quick note (e.g., <span class="itali">got it!)</span> to let them know you got their text or email and are on it. You could give a ballpark estimate as to when you&#x2019;ll be able to respond at more length.

If that&#x2019;s not possible, let your colleague know you&#x2019;ll get back to them with more answers when the time is right.

She shared a quick idea over email&#x2014;do you think we should add more research on oncology to the presentation? In her own mind, she was convinced she&#x2019;d said, &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s add an extra two bullet points on this slide&#x201D;&#x2014;but her brain was playing tricks on her. Two weeks later, her team had spent 30 hours or so preparing 40 slides on oncology research. The CMO had no idea the deck was coming, and had frankly forgotten about the two bullet points she&#x2019;d proposed. But her team had gotten used to responding in full to her requests, and seldom asked questions. Which made them felt even more devalued when their 40 slides turned into two bullet points on a slide.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1ent43r0o">Bottom line: If you&#x2019;re the boss, be mindful of writing &#x201C;think-alouds&#x201D; and separate them from true marching orders.

They feel valued, and what&#x2019;s more, everyone can get to know one another&#x2019;s names, faces, and presentation styles. Typically I schedule a discussion based on pre-reads I sent one or two days before the meeting. During my live webcasted workshops (where some attendees are in the room with me and others are watching online), I start my Q&amp;A by asking virtual participants to share their questions first, making it a point to remind the people in the room that they are not the only ones participating in the workshop.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idjfv9izilw">Anyone can create new norms and rituals to help ensure a company&#x2019;s culture puts a premium on recognition and respect.

Six months into his new leadership position, Xu is reaping the benefits. &#x201C;People feel more engaged, more a part of the mission,&#x201D; he says, &#x201C;because they know just how well they are doing both at every level.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1mgbqfwq8">Aria Finger, CEO of DoSomething.org, implemented a handful of simple yet memorable actions in her non-profit.

She asks every team member to email her directly by the end of the week and answer two questions: &#x201C;What&#x2019;s the bad news I don&#x2019;t want to hear?&#x201D; and, &#x201C;What might we have missed in our last discussion?&#x201D; She does this for a couple of reasons.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idgukttvxdl">First, asking for bad news creates a regular space to speak up about challenges in the business. Second, Lisa&#x2019;s introverts require more time to process ideas, and are more likely to speak up in an email or one-on-one. By giving them the space to think through the questions, Lisa gets excellent insights she wouldn&#x2019;t have gotten in the meeting, while reducing overall cultural groupthink. Lisa is also aware of the different ways team members engage in conversation, and goes out of her way to meet them where they are comfortable&#x2014;during a one-on-one post-meeting call, or at a small group lunch.

Sue was the head of licensing at a publicly traded fashion house. Every quarter she met with Doug, the CFO, to review her team&#x2019;s budget. Four times a year, her staff worked long hours, planning and documenting every aspect of its complicated budget. While Sue and her team had a great deal of mutual respect, at budget time the same issue always came up.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9mol94cir">It was this: Doug preferred to discuss the budget alone with Sue. Needless to say, this made her team feel excluded from the project they had all worked so hard to accomplish. Even more demotivating, there was never any recognition of the team&#x2019;s work, nor any explanation of subsequent budget changes. When Sue finally recognized the problem, she initiated a couple of simple processes. First, she made sure that everyone&#x2019;s name went into the final presentation, which clarified who had created what. Following each and every quarterly budget meeting with Doug, she also scheduled an immediate one-hour meeting with her team, during which she reviewed Doug&#x2019;s comments and feedback. She also wrote the CFO a follow-up email that acknowledged her team&#x2019;s individual efforts, citing the contribution each person made to the end product. Of course, she cc&#x2019;d her team as well so they could witness her singing their praises.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id81ms7ix32">In our increasingly competitive workplaces&#x2014;where both the pace and the technology make it easy to lose touch with the human connection&#x2014;this kind of valuing process makes a difference.</p><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="id91ly09806">Become a Meeting Ninja</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id4exkeccc8">Valuing visibly requires you to &#x201C;watch the clock&#x201D;&#x2014;and I mean that literally.

And could we do 10 second introductions of who&#x2019;s on the call?&#x201D; Immediately, a clear purpose was established.

This shows respect for your colleagues&#x2019; time, while also communicating accountability. At the beginning of a meeting, say, &#x201C;What success looks like for this meeting is XYZ&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#x201D; At the end, recap if you&#x2019;ve achieved that success, or list what&#x2019;s missing.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idajemzsmbd">At the start of every meeting or phone call, set aside five minutes to make introductions. Ask everyone to share one personal or professional update. This allows for increased vulnerability, familiarity and trust, and helps everyone involved understood where their colleagues are at. Twenty-four hours before the meeting, distribute an agenda that encourages different members to lead a section of the meeting. Periodically ask for input, instead of waiting until the end. Let everyone pitch in. If you&#x2019;re on a phone call, ban the Mute button in order to minimize awkward pauses and multitasking.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id5dg3d4vxh">Becoming a meeting ninja is also about knowing when to exclude others from meetings in deference to their time.

At one point my friend whispered to me that the waiters considered our party &#x201C;rude.&#x201D; It wasn&#x2019;t what anyone said, it was our tone and our cadence. You see, in Indian English, when people ask for something, they use an intonation with a falling contour so it comes off sounding like a statement, rather than a question.

I&#x2019;ll get the changes to you shortly,&#x201D; came the reply. But when the next draft arrived, none of the changes Selena had requested had been made, prompting her to call him and <span class="itali">command</span> he make the changes.

It wasn&#x2019;t&#x2014;it was a subtle warning. The same went for the changes Selena proposed&#x2014;they came across as <span class="itali">optional.</span> When the designer ignored them, was it any wonder Selena felt he wasn&#x2019;t listening, or that the designer believed his boss was now changing her mind?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idp1senlwq4">Gently, I explained to Selena that the problem was on <span class="itali">her</span> end. Her natural mode of engaging with colleagues was well-intentioned but off the mark in a digital age. If she wanted to succeed in her new leadership role, she would need to be much clearer. It wasn&#x2019;t that she lacked people skills&#x2014;Selena was doing everything possible to connect with her managers and staff&#x2014;it was that she needed to adjust her digital body language.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ido4q87fupg">The good news? Selena realized that clarity trumped politeness and would also help her colleagues thrive. She changed her feedback style to be more direct&#x2014;even including a bullet pointed list of requests!

This still works in real life, just not in the contemporary digital world. Even on video calls, there is a disconnect when people don&#x2019;t look at their cameras or you can&#x2019;t quite gauge expressions from the small participant boxes. Today, it&#x2019;s everyone&#x2019;s responsibility to consider the potential ways our communication could be interpreted (or misinterpreted), and adjust our writing style and tone accordingly.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idnxy2qyz1r"><span class="boldb">Communicate C</span><span class="boldb">arefully</span><span class="boldb"> </span>means putting out clear signals that keep everyone fully informed and aligned.

Wearily, I drafted an email to my client Katie, incorporating specific guidance connected to her current team challenges, along with a draft of a presentation I would be sharing with them later that week.

When you write, text or call your boss or colleagues, for instance, it&#x2019;s best to keep your tone neutral until you develop a rapport that would indicate differently.

I found myself caught in a back-and-forth email chain, all the while feeling like a put-upon pre-school teacher on the verge of screaming, &#x201C;Time out!&#x201D; In an effort to hash things out between them, I set up a video conference call.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idnwtsgo07q">Ultimately, Samantha and Tony were able to tolerate each other&#x2014;just barely, but enough to complete their tenure as&#x2014;what was the hopeful expression?&#x2014;&#x201C;collaboration champions.&#x201D; It wasn&#x2019;t that they couldn&#x2019;t work together. Instead, they needed to change the channel they were using from email to regular video calls. Video calls eliminated the miscommunication that resulted from their wildly different email styles, while adding visual cues that conveyed their emotions and (it&#x2019;s true) mutual good intentions.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id6cptqe9di">Then there are some people who get it right from the start.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idoxhdimaf9">A web applications company called Zapier has seemingly cracked the code around using the right collaboration channels, even coming out with a guide to help other companies do the same thing.<span class="EndnoteReference"><span class="endnotereference" id="endnoteref_31">31</span></span> Zapier&#x2019;s workforce is entirely remote, with almost everything shared via written communication. Every one of the company&#x2019;s collaboration tools serves a clear-cut purpose, while mimicking a parallel real-world office environment.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idzu4dim7pz">For example, the instant messaging platform Slack serves as Zapier&#x2019;s virtual office, e.g., &#x201C;if you&#x2019;re in Slack, then you&#x2019;re at work.&#x201D;<span class="EndnoteReference"><span class="endnotereference" id="endnoteref_32">32</span></span> Within Slack, company employees have created both work and non-work related channels (messaging chains), ranging from &#x201C;marketing&#x201D; and &#x201C;hacking&#x201D; to &#x201C;water cooler.&#x201D; These discreet &#x201C;rooms&#x201D; ensure that employees&#x2019; messages are seen by the appropriate audience, especially as teams grow beyond a dozen or so people, increasing the likelihood of duplication across channels.<span class="EndnoteReference"><span class="endnotereference" id="endnoteref_33">33</span></span> Every &#x201C;room&#x201D; also has its own working policies and moderators that are revised and upgraded over time. Zapier also makes use of Slack tool integration like Trello, GitHub and Google Docs, with each one, again, serving a clear purpose. Finally, the company keeps everything organized by adhering to detailed norms around when and how to use each tool.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idy0gpwsioc">One of the most powerful things we can do is take pains to specify appropriate channels and formats across the culture. You don&#x2019;t have to always stick to the same communication medium, but make sure you choose the <span class="itali">right</span> one for the right message. Using the wrong channel at the wrong time can even have professional consequences, damaging trust or even branding you as unsophisticated or unsympathetic.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idiqzx6em9a">I teach clients about the implications of choosing the right channel by focusing on three issues: <span class="boldb">L</span><span class="boldb">ength</span><span class="boldb">;</span><span class="boldb"> </span><span class="boldb">C</span><span class="boldb">omplexity</span><span class="boldb">;</span><span class="boldb"> and </span><span class="boldb">F</span><span class="boldb">amiliarity</span>.</p><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="idqklu2e4q8">Length, Complexity, and Familiarity</p><p class="B-HeadBhead" id="id5lgraov1f">Length: How Deep is the Ocean?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idod9r6jex9">Of these three issues, <span class="itali">l</span><span class="itali">ength </span>is the easiest one to manage. Most of us have family members, or colleagues, who send multiple, consecutive texts, as they&#x2019;re seemingly unable to squeeze their thoughts or ideas into one or two. If you want to provide someone with a lengthy (e.g. more than a short paragraph) update, use email, and for heaven&#x2019;s sakes, refrain from using channels like instant messaging. Use bold, underlined headings, attachments if applicable, and make sure you share specific context briefly upfront so readers understand why it&#x2019;s important. Bottom line: if your message doesn&#x2019;t match the medium, find a more appropriate channel.</p><p class="B-HeadBhead" id="idrn3gt8ec0">Complexity: Parsing Intricacy</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idb7vczq55t"><span class="itali">Complexity</span> is a lot harder to figure out. The general rule of thumb is that bigger, broader ideas require more reflection and/or nuanced thinking. If you&#x2019;re gearing up to make a complex argument, it&#x2019;s best to choose a medium (including posting a deck or blogging), that permits a greater level of detail, and that also supports add-on elements like photos, video or space for feedback or comments.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idt5s853hsi">Again, always be aware of the <span class="itali">visual</span> impact of your message. If it goes on too long, you risk overwhelming people. Also, too many boldfaced or underlined words can come across as chaotic. Images (appropriate ones) can both clarify and enhance trust, but superfluous ones are too often distracting.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idb343k3agm">Be conscious as well of the <span class="itali">timing</span> of complex messages. Don&#x2019;t expect your team to absorb a novella-length email that you decide to send it out at 5pm on a Friday, and respond to it thoughtfully an hour later. Nor should you wait until the last minute to send complex messages that may invite some back-and-forth. In both cases, it&#x2019;s best to end your message with an invitation for a phone call or an in-person meeting to go over the smaller details.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddwinsj0wz">Again, always use the channel that suits the tone and message you want to convey, bearing in mind that just because we live in a digital world doesn&#x2019;t mean digital is the only way to go.</p><p class="TABLETBL" id="id6bvlipgmc">TABLE</p><table><tr><td><p class="Table-HeadTbhd">Complexity of argument</p></td><td><p class="Table-HeadTbhd">Best Channels to Use</p></td><td><p class="Table-HeadTbhd">Why?</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="Table-TextTbtx">High</p></td><td><p class="Table-TextTbtx">Posting or Blogging, Visual presentations, Video calls </p></td><td><p class="Table-TextTbtx">Allows for greater trust-building, and can also include supporting elements, like photos, video and even a feedback or comments option</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="Table-TextTbtx">Medium</p></td><td><p class="Table-TextTbtx">Email, phone and group conference calls</p></td><td><p class="Table-TextTbtx">Allows for more context and color on the topic, as well as back-and-forth exchanges for discussion</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="Table-TextTbtx">Low</p></td><td><p class="Table-TextTbtx">Group messaging tools (IM, text, chat tools)</p></td><td><p class="Table-TextTbtx">Allows for immediate and low-impact distractions, time to process or send immediate response if preferred, ability to use less context</p></td></tr></table><p class="ENDEND" id="id53d5td5qa">END TABLE</p><p class="B-HeadBhead" id="idiu4yd9qo7">Familiarity</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id3xw9nzc8e"><span class="itali">Familiarity</span> refers not only to our relationship to the recipient(s) of what we write, but also the <span class="itali">content</span> of what we&#x2019;re saying. Who is your audience? If you have a close relationship with someone, sending that person a text may be a welcome, neutral disruption. But in a business relationship, most people prefer communicating via email, which allows them to scan the subject line and decide when (or even if) to open and read your message.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idqb7nl8jju">Consider your content. Is it personal or confidential? If it is, make sure you build trust by sending a direct private message, versus a public tweet or group IM.</p><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="idc51plrunj">Length, Complexity and Familiarity: Putting It All Together</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id8hjbjdpn9">We&#x2019;ve now gone over the three factors involved in choosing the channel that shows your respect for other people&#x2019;s limited time and attention. Within each one, of course, are variations, or special circumstances. For instance, I often hear that video meetings are a preferred option when face-to-face meetings aren&#x2019;t possible. But, as we all know by now, video meetings are far from perfect, with many feeling decidedly <span class="itali">un</span>-collaborative and more like siloed lectures, where one or two people at a time bang on while everyone else is forced to listen. But there are ways around this. Zoom, for example, offers &#x201C;Breakout Rooms&#x201D; that sequester meeting participants in standalone rooms of any size. Zoom also lets participants use a virtual whiteboard during sessions, so that everyone present can write, collaborate simultaneously, thereby building shared context.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idnurc042wm">Recently, an organization brought me in to assess one of its team&#x2019;s digital communications, which made up most of their &#x201C;update culture.&#x201D; The division leader wanted to know why there was so much daily dysfunction: missed deadlines, emails ignored, reports of uncomfortable chat room conversations, and a lot of peer-based passive-aggressiveness.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddrevjkv6z">It didn&#x2019;t take me long to discover that the team in question was using its collaboration tools in every which way but the right one! In the team&#x2019;s hands, Microsoft Teams chat had become a way for members to avoid face-to-face collaboration. Members were also sharing the same messages and documents using multiple collaboration tools, making it hard for anybody to know where to go for what. Finally, some members were commenting on tasks using 10-word IM messages, without explaining if their message was an opinion or a request for action.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddvn4ym37y">Eventually, the team and I created norms around the best, most proper use of every communication channel. Here&#x2019;s what we built:</p><p class="Image-PlacementImg" id="idf9fx00klr">Image001.pdf</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idpnydzqcf6">Setting collaboration channel norms wasn&#x2019;t hard. No, the hard part was making sure teams <span class="itali">followed</span> <span class="itali">through</span> with these new behaviors, and didn&#x2019;t gradually slide back to their old ways. Mindful of this, we identified two or three channel advocates, whose role was to encourage best practices within each channel, and give shout-outs to those who were modeling the right behaviors. Finally, we developed a practice designed to eliminate situations where individuals duplicated content unnecessarily across multiple channels by rolling out the phrase #killduplication.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id33ag1gdsx">The #killduplication phrase is now a staple in the team culture, helping to eliminate wasted time and ensure colleagues optimize the use of each digital medium.</p><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="idzx5kptzj7">The Commitments are in the Details</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1s82urc91">A longstanding client of mine, an accounting firm, once called me in the wake of the failed product launch targeted at a new customer segment.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iduwdyrp5sd">The project had been launched only a few months earlier. Here&#x2019;s how it was done. First, the marketing department invited<span class="boldb"> </span>660 attendees (50 percent of all employees) to a town hall meeting hosted by the CEO, who presented a formal PowerPoint presentation followed by a half-hour Q&amp;A. Other members of the marketing team hosted a follow up chat on Yammer (a closed-network social platform), and a special lunch for second level managers. Everyone went around using language like &#x201C;This is a <span class="itali">big</span> opportunity&#x201D; and &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s spark a change&#x201D; to make sure employees understood they were embarking on something extraordinary. They were perplexed when, a month later, nothing happened. All of the ideas had become stuck in the planning stage and many were set aside completely for &#x2018;more pressing&#x2019; work.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idureq261s3">Well, here&#x2019;s <span class="itali">why</span> nothing happened. At no time did the leadership team ask managers to write down clear, transparent commitments around what they and their teams planned on doing to engage customers, or work alongside the marketing department, or which benchmarks they should prioritize.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddy6dpueun">To get everyone back on track, the executive team and I asked each team member to commit to communicating the details of the new offering to existing and potential clients by the end of the week. Next, we used Microsoft Teams to track their progress, with mechanisms in place to provide scripts, share client FAQs and enlist executives in high priority discussions. This simple practice allowed the teams to make fewer, better commitments and stick to them.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1806mei3v">The hardest part of any promise? <span class="itali">Staying</span><span class="itali"> on track.</span> The more networked an organization is, the more touchpoints and requests and people to say &#x201C;yes&#x201D; to a team has to deal with. To reduce confusion, I always advise writing down and tracking individual and team commitments. At every stage of a project, list your key ongoing commitments. For example: &#x201C;I will provide my team with the resources they need in these areas: website updates, product rollouts, and communications.&#x201D; Under those, list your specific promises, e.g. &#x201C;I will hire two new engineers by the end of September.&#x201D;</p><p class="Custom1Cust1" id="idi6s6xools">#AskErica</p><p class="BOX-BBOX-B" id="idivves9nbs">BOX-B</p><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="id9q9uk3fpw">How can I make sure my team follow through with commitments?</p><p class="Bullet-Level-1-ListBl1" id="ido6k0j8wx1">Is the commitment observable and measurable?</p><p class="Bullet-Level-1-ListBl1" id="idt8kw2fowu">If the commitment is carried out well, will it support or leverage change that works toward the team&#x2019;s stated goal or benchmark?</p><p class="Bullet-Level-1-ListBl1" id="idvny3nfvkg">Do individuals or teams have all of the resources they need to fulfill this commitment?</p><p class="Bullet-Level-1-ListBl1" id="idu7csrs3mh">Does this commitment risk overextending our team?

At one point she noticed that the ingredients list included in product advertisements was different from the list appearing on the bottles (some ingredients, it seemed, were banned in Europe).</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddhxjz3gec">&#x201C;No one told the marketing department, though,&#x201D; Henderson said.<span class="EndnoteReference"><span class="endnotereference" id="endnoteref_37">37</span></span> Five separate company units&#x2014;marketing, communications, technical, legal and packaging&#x2014;were supposed to be apprised of updates and changes throughout the rollout.

Where are people going to really need to understand the processes, the requirements, the regulations?&#x201D;<span class="EndnoteReference"><span class="endnotereference" id="endnoteref_40">40</span></span> Most critically, she advocates prioritizing the right people who can make a project better, while also identifying who can best anticipate bottlenecks, or call out the BS.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idc79n5wk66">Posing the simple question, &#x201C;Who could derail this?&#x201D; can avoid leaving off important individuals who could later hamper your efforts, from a front-line cashier to a new customer representative to a risk manager. Shallet considers<span class="itali"> all</span> stakeholders, including people who may not be making the decision but have to implement it. Additionally, she asks all departments involved to break down proposals and issues into layman&#x2019;s terms. For example, engineering, management and legal all speak different languages. To ensure these disparate voices understand one another, each is expected to express their ideas using clear, jargon-free language.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idb7ho9dp3i">Caroline, a team leader at a pharmaceutical company, designates &#x201C;Project Team Members&#x201D; and &#x201C;Project Advisors.&#x201D; Team Members are involved in decision making and control of the day-to-day activities, while Project Advisors are subject matter experts, and are only included on meeting summaries (this keeps them in the loop) or in 1:1 conversations when their expertise is required.

In a manufacturing plant, for example, a missed deadline can cause chaos for countless stakeholders along the supply chain. But in other settings, there is less at stake in missing a precise deadline, and deadlines are understood to be rough&#x2014;calibrated for &#x201C;noonish,&#x201D; &#x201C;ASAP,&#x201D; or &#x201C;first thing in the morning.&#x201D; These requests may or may not feel urgent. Particularly in creative industries that involve iteration and innovation, it&#x2019;s understood that deadlines may not be met if the idea just hasn&#x2019;t reached completion. The problem arises when one team or one person&#x2019;s missed deadline causes a delay down the chain for someone else.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id8dhn2bayu">Most organizations deal with all of these scenarios at one time or another. When people are collaborating from different places, time zones, working hours, language barriers, and more all contribute to a more difficult time meeting deadlines. And so it&#x2019;s important that managers have a system in place that creates realistic deadlines, are clear about the consequences of missing them, and considers contingencies for when (inevitably) something goes wrong.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idwcub4eaf5"><span class="itali">Be thoughtful</span> about deadlines. When setting major deadlines with her management team, Mary, an SVP at a hospitality company division, always prefaced her scheduling meetings with a <span class="itali">caveat</span>: &#x201C;I&#x2019;m thinking out loud and believe the deadline should be December 1.

In addition, Mary <span class="itali">welcomed</span> email from employees who didn&#x2019;t speak up in meetings.

Missed or crisscrossing messages can undo collaboration confidence by creating misunderstandings, leading to broken commitments or canceled meetings. They can also lead to widespread inaction or worse, chaos.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idduu4c6z1j">The gaps we all experience in response times bring with them another problem, namely, that circumstances can change dramatically before we&#x2019;ve gotten an answer to the first email we sent. In addition, our need for a response increases with every second we sit there, making us feel impatient, resentful and stressed-out. This issue is especially germane for global leaders with teams in multiple time zones.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id51b62y79b">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll wake up in New York to a flurry of 50 email exchanges about an issue in our Shanghai office,&#x201D; says Sam, a shared services leader at Walt Disney Parks and Resorts. &#x201C;People freak out because they haven&#x2019;t heard back from me yet, don&#x2019;t read the latest reply with an update before responding and keep sending emails instead of giving me a call.&#x201D;. As a manager of teams across his company&#x2019;s Orlando, Shanghai and Paris theme parks, Sam goes bananas when his team sends volumes of emails without checking first that they&#x2019;re adding genuine value to the infinitely long, &#x201C;Reply All&#x201D; chain.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idtdj6v33kf">If you can withstand the blind impulse to respond to an email immediately, well, there&#x2019;s a lot of power and control to be found in the ensuing silence. Unless the message is urgent or time-sensitive, don&#x2019;t drop everything to respond at once. The collective interest (your own included) is far better served by a measured, strategic reply.<span class="itali"> </span>Silence allows us to gain perspective, to consider every angle, to review what&#x2019;s happened and anticipate what might come next.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idjzvbmndkc">Digital hastiness can also foster groupthink and undermine team creativity. 6 &#x2018;yes&#x2019; emails in a chain make it harder for the 7<span class="supersup">th</span> person to say no. The mute button reduces creative flow and concentration.

For all its drawbacks, asynchronous communication gives us time to process our words, instead of just blurting them out. Needless to say, this is a very real advantage.

The digitally-dependent workplace allows many of us to show what we&#x2019;ve been made of all along, and to reveal our potentials with more depth than ever thought possible.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idh2jy3cw8h">It&#x2019;s a good thing, too, because in the future, even the most conservative, long-established fields and businesses will be obliged to reinvent themselves digitally. I finished writing this book in quarantine with my family during the Covid-19 outbreak. As the world locked down, and many people began working from home for the first time, companies quickly adapted to Zoom, WebEx, Facetime and&#x2014;<span class="itali">oh, </span><span class="itali">right!</span><span class="itali">&#x2014;</span>the phone. It wasn&#x2019;t that bad either. The number of individuals hosting Slack chats or virtual happy hours on Zoom went through the roof. We also got very good at sharing and tracking our work by email. As every organization that could entered the digital arena, mastering a common digital body language to enables clarity, speed, and efficiency became more crucial than ever.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idjhvb4bb8b">Another thing changed as I was writing this book. My original mission was to help people alleviate a widespread source of professional confusion and pain&#x2014;but along the way I learned that understanding the nuances of digital body language doesn&#x2019;t merely solve problems, it also opens up deeper, better ways for all of us to relate and foster a sense of inclusion and belonging. This benefits <span class="itali">everyone</span> in business, from executives to managers to team members, by creating environments that allow the very best ideas to come forth and shine.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id6tf3wvihs">Today, we can access a much broader diversity of perspectives. Digital body language reduces friction, limits bureaucracy, and creates a clear universal language. We waste less time on low-level information. We spend more on the things that matter. When used well, digital body language also flattens the differences across genders, generations, and cultures. Research shows that well-managed, virtual teams that have never met face-to-face actually outperform co-located teams since they make use of a broader range of resources, insight, experience and perspectives.<span class="FootnoteReference FootnoteRef" id="footnote_1">1</span> By establishing clear digital body language standards, managers now have a key tool that helps them build even more successful teams in the future.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idwam8zgl0p">I hope this book helps you bridge the twenty-first century differences common among teams. By helping us succeed in a modern workspace, Digital Body Language goes a long way toward building greater trust, connection and authenticity, allowing us to communicate better and build stronger relationships, not only when we&#x2019;re working alone, but also when we&#x2019;re working together.</p><p class="Section-AppendixSAP" id="idd0b6nrw9j">Appendix</p><p class="TitleTtl" id="id6lygd9ufy">Appendix</p><p class="TitleTtl" id="idqp50n70h8">DIGITAL BODY LANGUAGE GUIDEBOOK</p><p class="SubtitleSttl" id="id29xmv8b15">How do I apply what I&#x2019;ve learned?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idxr82swkaw">To get you started, I&#x2019;ve put together a practical, instructive guidebook that you can find on my website, ericadhawan.com.</p><p class="Bullet-Level-1-ListBl1" id="idlvftcs84u"><span class="boldb">Digital Body Language Style Guide: </span>A digital &#x201C;Elements of Style&#x201D; guide that you can use alone or with your team, that includes pro tips and the do&#x2019;s and don&#x2019;ts of digital body language.

For those sent by people ages 20-to-35, that number dropped to 16 minutes. People between the ages 35 and 50 typically answered within 24 minutes; and people 50 and older responded roughly 47 minutes later. In the time since that study was published, arguably we are only getting faster, since more of us are using our mobile phones to respond, lowering response times even further.</p><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idu1nj9mk3o">2. <span class="boldb">Value others with a &#x201C;read receipt.&#x201D; </span>As email has become a faster paced channel, it&#x2019;s always a good idea to let the other party know if you got their email, but need more than a few hours to respond. Instead of leaving the recipient waiting (or getting anxious), reply with a quick &#x201C;Got it! I&#x2019;ll get back to you by Tuesday.&#x201D;</p><p class="List-HeadLhead" id="idnizlh7su0">The Structure:</p><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idj50cymo9a">1. <span class="boldb">Use the subject line to set the tone for your recipient before they even open your email.</span> Leaving a subject line empty is a wasted opportunity, and some older recipients even consider it a mark of disrespect. Consider this: how do email marketers get you to click on their message? Answer: a catchy subject line that promises you a discount, a sale, a preview or a listicle. At work, we&#x2019;re all marketing ourselves&#x2014;so why not get others to prioritize your requests? Do this by always starting with a specific and action-oriented subject line.</p><p class="Unnum-Level-2-ListUl2" id="idll15ok5iu"><span class="itali" style="text-decoration: underline;">Do: </span><span class="itali">Roadside Inc Project Report Final Edits / Review by EOD 4/10</span></p><p class="Unnum-Level-2-ListUl2" id="id9l53g2z2x"><span class="itali" style="text-decoration: underline;">Don&#x2019;t:</span><span class="itali"> Project Report</span></p><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idx3sk4hz4i">2. <span class="boldb">Be direct. </span>There&#x2019;s no need to restate the subject line immediately, but skip the pleasantries. For the most part, business emails don&#x2019;t require you asking questions like, &#x201C;How&#x2019;s your day?&#x201D; or wondering how the kids are doing. Get to the point.</p><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idmj62xvqf3">3. <span class="boldb">Proofread for clarity, not just grammar. </span><span class="itali">Anyone</span> can get confused by an email. Just because you write to coworkers whom you see every day doesn&#x2019;t mean they can always interpret your intent (or read your mind). Try not to be cryptic. Reread your email and ask yourself,<span class="itali"> If I wasn&#x2019;t me, or in my own head, would I understand my message? </span>This isn&#x2019;t an easy skill to develop, so ask for feedback from the receiver or from another proofreader.

Clear the deck. If an email chain continues for more than three or four rounds, the entire subject line becomes a row of &#x201C;Re:&#x201D;s and &#x201C;Fwd:&#x201D;s. Replace those with a relevant, concise, action-oriented subject line for the email you&#x2019;re about to send.</p><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="id2pi4mli33">3. Avoid stress-inducing subject lines like &#x201C;Please call me&#x201D; or &#x201C;See CEO in his office.&#x201D; They&#x2019;re not what we mean by &#x201C;action-oriented.&#x201D; Be brief, by all means, but don&#x2019;t forget to include the necessary context.</p><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idsrkdoiwyg">4. If you need to add a link, embed it into text by highlighting the relevant words. and using the Insert Link function offered by Office, Gmail, Yahoo, and most other email programs. If your company works on an internal server, you can highlight the location of a document, and embed it into the text in the same way.</p><p class="List-HeadLhead" id="idi4vtk204b">When should the email conversation switch to a different medium?</p><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="id9gd3t3ohg">1. Emails longer than 5 sentences are typically skimmed over! For more complex topics and assignments, opt for a phone call or meeting, or make sure you use bullet points, bold and italic text, while highlighting the action points at the end.</p><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idzp4lygqvl">2. Ask yourself: Do I or the other person need more context beyond what email can provide? If the answer is yes, schedule a face-to-face discussion or a phone meeting.</p><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="idwcxikyjmg">TEXT AND INSTANT MESSAGING</p><p class="Custom2Cust2" id="id6cgoi90zo"><span class="itali">Channels: text message, Skype messenger, Slack, Google Chat, etc.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idq6nhebrcb">As the level of formality in the workplace decreases, texting and instant messaging have become increasingly prevalent. In this section, we will combine the two shorthand forms of digital communication to discuss them globally, but take note of a few important distinctions along the way.</p><p class="List-HeadLhead" id="id3e0dtu7g9">The Audience:</p><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idhtqvs6n1f">1. <span class="boldb">It&#x2019;s casual. </span>In general, your audience for these channels should be informal. The shorthand, emojis, and exaggerated punctuation we use to create tone in texts and IMs are generally inappropriate in formal discussions. In a professional setting, try to write in complete sentences (though you don&#x2019;t have to write out every word). Abbreviations are okay.</p><p class="List-HeadLhead" id="id6k8rd76ih">The Timing:</p><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="id278npa164">1. <span class="boldb">These channels are meant to be</span><span class="boldb">&#x2014;</span><span class="boldb">you guessed it</span><span class="boldb">&#x2014;</span><span class="bold-italbi">instant.</span><span class="itali"> </span>For the most part, a response is expected within the hour, although most come within 3 minutes or less. If you get a text during a meeting and can&#x2019;t respond immediately, it&#x2019;s a good idea to let recipients know why they haven&#x2019;t heard from you.</p><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idv8tjs37pe">2. <span class="boldb">Create boundaries. </span>The instantaneous nature of these channels can be misleading. People often use text and IM outside of work hours, and still expect a quick response. It&#x2019;s perfectly reasonable to establish boundaries. If it&#x2019;s the first time, respond to the off-hour text with a quick message telling the sender that you won&#x2019;t be answering until work hours.</p><p class="List-HeadLhead" id="idu6q8asaeb">The Structure:</p><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idlh9i8bf4m">1. <span class="boldb">Less structure is better. </span>These are informal channels, meaning there&#x2019;s no reason to include a subject line, formal greeting, or signature.

Ensure that everyone is identified, along with their position, at the start, and allow a few minutes for social chatter.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idqblbfnk6n">The Timing:</p><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="id03du0w7qs">1. <span class="boldb">Keep things short and sweet. </span>Most of us are accustomed to face-to-face meetings and conference sessions that last over an hour. In that kind of three-dimensional environment, participants have a full range of stimuli, fewer outside distractions, and are generally more easily engaged for longer periods of time. Virtual events leave much more room for distractions and multitasking. A planned structure and a ticking clock can help. Productive virtual meetings have a predetermined time frame, limiting the number of ideas that each member will bring.</p><p class="Unnum-Level-2-ListUl2" id="idqq085atul"><span class="itali" style="text-decoration: underline;">Do:</span><span class="itali"> Ask your team to bring 3 solutions to a Zoom meeting that will be capped at 60-minutes.</span></p><p class="Unnum-Level-2-ListUl2" id="idh6u85sy98"><span class="itali" style="text-decoration: underline;">Don&#x2019;t:</span><span class="itali"> Schedule a 3-hour Zoom meeting and forget to send out an agenda that your team can use to prepare.</span></p><p class="List-HeadLhead" id="ideiw6lcokt">The Structure:</p><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="id1dvbbho8w">2. <span class="boldb">Raise your hand. </span>One great advantage of video chatting is that built-in mechanisms often exist for raising your hand (the space bar can generate hand-raising on Zoom). This can help avoid the issues common with phone calls, e.g., people talking over one another, or cutting someone off. If your software lacks a &#x201C;hand raise&#x201D; feature, you can establish one in a side chatbox. Designate a signal&#x2014;like an asterisk&#x2014;to allow team members to request their turn to speak. (This requires careful moderating and good leadership.) Make sure you&#x2019;re not overlooking anyone, and try to ask for opinions from the silent types.</p><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="id5z5g7kowe">3. <span class="boldb">Require that all participants be on camera.</span> As a rule, if someone else&#x2019;s camera is on, yours should be too. The camera restores some of the body language cues that digital communication takes away, while allowing team members to see with their own eyes that everyone in the room is fully engaged, and not scrolling Instagram.</p><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idy19tefjl5">4. <span class="boldb">Always appoint a moderator or MC. </span>Having a consistent face and voice that &#x201C;stitches together&#x201D; the virtual sessions for participants adds much-needed familiarity, and helps to lessen feelings of isolation that online occasionally bring. One good tip is to have the event moderator open up the conference or meeting, while taking charge of staying on the agenda and moderating questions for speakers as they pop up in the sideline chat.</p><p class="List-HeadLhead" id="id1rwbrclk2">Pro Tips:</p><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idh1yix2kwn">1. <span class="boldb">Test your technology. </span>If you haven&#x2019;t used Zoom or Skype in more than a few days, open your software before the scheduled time and test out both the video and microphone quality. This saves everybody time, while allowing you to skip the &#x201C;CAN YOU HEAR ME?&#x201D; section of the meeting.</p><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idub28iy92u">2. <span class="boldb">Silence.</span> Insist that everyone use the Mute button to prevent audio feedback and keep breathing, writing, and fidgeting noises (otherwise known as distractions) to a bare minimum.</p><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="id1dox601wr">3. <span class="boldb">Slow down.</span> Practice the 5-second rule, e.g., wait 5 seconds before speaking after you ask the group a question. This gap allows your team to process what you just said, while filling in the few seconds where everyone is busy wondering &#x201C;Is someone else going to speak up first?&#x201D; before going forward themselves.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id0w7pbr6ls">When should the conversation switch to a different medium?</p><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idhz82czpns">1.

Now is a good time to establish formal norms. Remember, creating digital norms if your team doesn&#x2019;t have universal principles or rules. Each team should first consider the preferences, background, and specific functions of its members. The questions below will help team members understand their own digital body language style, which they can then share with the group. Be on the lookout for similarities and differences.

Allow for social chatter before meetings, or create group messaging chains specifically desgined for conversations that go beyond work tasks.</p><p class="Bullet-Level-1-ListBl1" id="idus0zxzl25"> Value Visibly: Create spaces for celebration. Share inspiration with your team in the form of interesting articles, podcasts, or books.</p><p class="Bullet-Level-1-ListBl1" id="idb2l3lj3ld"> Value Visibly: Encourage your team to show appreciation by giving each other shout-outs, or starting meetings with MVP awards or &#x201C;Wins of the Week.&#x201D; One company I worked with celebrated new talent by creating a personal emoji for each employee who had been there for six months.

They crowd-source your team for what&#x2019;s realistic by considering overall workloads and outside forces that may create delays.</p><p class="Alpha-Level-2-ListAl2" id="id1cdhecwfw">b. They set the deadline on their own, or based on the needs of clients (or other outside forces), and present it along with the task. Usually the deadlines are realistic, but sometimes they create a a time crunch. It&#x2019;s okay with you since you can&#x2019;t really control clients or suppliers.</p><p class="Alpha-Level-2-ListAl2" id="idsvh39fdgn">c. They set completely arbitrary and unrealistic deadlines. They ask for days of work to be completed overnight.

You don&#x2019;t share your concerns with your team even though you have no idea where to find the resources you&#x2019;ll need to get the task done.

You have a system of scheduled, periodic evaluations, which you typically leave equipped with actionable tips for improvement.</p><p class="Alpha-Level-2-ListAl2" id="id4356j9bxl">b. Sometimes. They provide feedback only at the end of large projects. You get concerned when they ask to meet to give you feedback, even if you know you haven&#x2019;t done anything wrong. You have periodic evaluations that are seldom useful.</p><p class="Alpha-Level-2-ListAl2" id="idr456gqepg">c. Rarely or never. You only really hear feedback if something goes wrong.

Doesn&#x2019;t have a clear set of norms&#x2014;but there isn&#x2019;t much confusion about it either. Usually you&#x2019;re not concerned about which channel to use, but now and then you get annoyed by out-of-the-blue phone calls, confusing or cryptic emails, or inappropriate texts and IMs.</p><p class="Alpha-Level-2-ListAl2" id="idhou4ufgtg">c. Is a mess. You don&#x2019;t have any norms and there is often confusion.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idr0jq6zz82">Messages are often chronically lost, or never get answered.</p><p class="Unnum-Level-1-ListUl1" id="idkhw7fsjj3">It&#x2019;s the night before a major presentation and your partner hasn&#x2019;t added their slides to the presentation PowerPoint.

Excited for tomorrow!&#x201D;</p><p class="Alpha-Level-2-ListAl2" id="idq58p9mjgw">b. Are a bit worried that maybe they have the date wrong, or even forgot about it.

Your teammates and leaders often give you kudos for your contributions.</p><p class="Alpha-Level-2-ListAl2" id="id4kw2h791v">b. When your area of expertise is front and center. You try to stay quiet when you&#x2019;re not 100 percent sure of your opinions. When you do speak up, your team acknowledges your good ideas.</p><p class="Alpha-Level-2-ListAl2" id="idmql9kd75b">c.

She may include a single pleasantry&#x2014;&#x201C;Have a great day!&#x201D; or &#x201C;Let me know if I can help further.&#x201D; She uses emojis as additions to texts and IM&#x2019;s. They don&#x2019;t take the place of words, but she&#x2019;ll usually add a smiley face or a thumbs-up to the end of a message to add some emotion. Generally Alice answers emails within 2 or 3 hours, responds to texts within a few minutes, and answers calendar requests almost immediately. If she knows her response will be delayed, she always lets the other person know.

As for response times, well, it depends on the person who sent her the email. If it&#x2019;s her boss, she&#x2019;ll respond at once. If it&#x2019;s from someone she dislikes, she&#x2019;ll push against the boundaries of acceptable (but never too far).</p><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="id4a3gid6jv">Charlie</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idvm5m0j806">The emails Charlie sends always contain fewer than five sentences. It&#x2019;s like texting. You and Charlie tend to go back and forth using short emails. Charlie loves emojijs, as they&#x2019;re much easier than typing out full sentences, and he easily substitute emojis for words or entire sentences. He is more than willing to sacrifice a few typos here and there for the sake of speed.</p><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="idkv97pyowf">David</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idz0c0i9zji">David sends lengthy emails, overflowing with details, avoiding any need for a follow-up email or call.

He would never use emojis at work, seeing them as unprofessional (plus, to be honest, he has no idea what some of them mean). He always triple-checks his messages before pressing Send.</p><p class="SeparatorSep" id="idpb0zdkkxh">[Separator]</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idz0zs9z08k"><span class="boldb">If you are mostly Alice:</span> Great job.
