Armour, the wealthy packing-house king, who decided to hear the sermon.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idyy7htxonu">In his sermon Dr. Gunsaulus pictured a great school of technology where young men and young women could be taught how to succeed in life by developing the ability to THINK in practical rather than in theoretical terms; where they would be taught to &#x201C;learn by doing.&#x201D; &#x201C;If I had a million dollars,&#x201D; said the young preacher, &#x201C;I would start such a school.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idqqwvfba3d">After the sermon was over Mr. Armour walked down the aisle to the pulpit, introduced himself, and said, &#x201C;Young man, I believe you could do all you said you could, and if you will come down to my office tomorrow morning I will give you the million dollars you need.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id6w5317q20">There is always plenty of capital for those who can create practical plans for using it.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id76d47kc5g">That was the beginning of the Armour Institute of Technology, one of the very practical schools of the country. The school was born in the &#x201C;imagination&#x201D; of a young man who never would have been heard of outside of the community in which he preached had it not been for the &#x201C;imagination,&#x201D; plus the capital, of Philip D. Armour.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idosx357tha">Every great railroad, and every outstanding financial institution and every mammoth business enterprise, and every great invention, began in the imagination of some one person.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id8zg3qvyhy">F. W. Woolworth created the Five and Ten Cent Store Plan in his &#x201C;imagination&#x201D; before it became a reality and made him a multimillionaire.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ids07b6gwo2">Thomas A. Edison created the talking machine and the moving picture machine and the incandescent electric light bulb and scores of other useful inventions, in his own &#x201C;imagination,&#x201D; before they became a reality.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idq5bb6yvr6">During the Chicago fire scores of merchants whose stores went up in smoke stood near the smoldering embers of their former places of business, grieving over their loss. Many of them decided to go away into other cities and start over again. In the group was Marshall Field, who saw, in his own &#x201C;imagination,&#x201D; the world&#x2019;s greatest retail store, standing on the selfsame spot where his former store had stood, which was then but a ruined mass of smoking timbers. That store became a reality.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idnha3qhsep">Fortunate is the young man or young woman who learns, early in life, to use imagination, and doubly so in this age of greater opportunity.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1rkgqwnov">Imagination is a faculty of the mind which can be cultivated, developed, extended and broadened by use. If this were not true, this course on the Fifteen Laws of Success never would have been created, because it was first conceived in the author&#x2019;s &#x201C;imagination,&#x201D; from the mere seed of an idea which was sown by a chance remark of the late Andrew Carnegie.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ido1zczlsuk">Wherever you are, whoever you are, whatever you may be following as an occupation, there is room for you to make yourself more useful, and in that manner more productive, by developing and using your &#x201C;imagination.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idkcfwtfe2j">Success in this world is always a matter of individual effort, yet you will only be deceiving yourself if you believe that you can succeed without the co-operation of other people. Success is a matter of individual effort only to the extent that each person must decide, in his or her own mind, what is wanted. This involves the use of &#x201C;imagination.&#x201D; From this point on, achieving success is a matter of skillfully and tactfully inducing others to co-operate.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idsz1dvlj42">Before you can secure co-operation from others; nay, before you have the right to ask for or expect co-operation from other people, you must first show a willingness to co-operate with them. For this reason the eighth lesson of this course, THE HABIT OF DOING MORE THAN PAID FOR, is one which should have your serious and thoughtful attention. The law upon which this lesson is based, would, of itself, practically insure success to all who practice it in all they do.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idpvnxxxf2k">In the back pages of this Introduction you will observe a Personal Analysis Chart in which ten well known men have been analyzed for your study and comparison. Observe this chart carefully and note the &#x201C;danger points&#x201D; which mean failure to those who do not observe these signals. Of the ten men analyzed eight are known to be successful, while two may be considered failures. Study, carefully, the reason why these two men failed.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idkon8g3o1r">Then, study yourself. In the two columns which have been left blank for that purpose, give yourself a rating on each of the Fifteen Laws of Success at the beginning of this course; at the end of the course rate yourself again and observe the improvements you have made.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idhhszcdeu9">The purpose of the Law of Success course is to enable you to find out how you may become more capable in your chosen field of work. To this end you will be analyzed and all of your qualities classified so you may organize them and make the best possible use of them.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idovey3dn0t">You may not like the work in which you are now engaged.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idiycvk5ovr">There are two ways of getting out of that work. One way is to take but little interest in what you are doing, aiming merely to do enough with which to &#x201C;get by.&#x201D; Very soon you will find a way out, because the demand for your services will cease.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id4g67e2hhj">The other and better way is by making yourself so useful and efficient in what you are now doing that you will attract the favorable attention of those who have the power to promote you into more responsible work that is more to your liking.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idgo2wiwj64">It is your privilege to take your choice as to which way you will proceed.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idoi1gyy17l">Again you are reminded of the importance of Lesson Nine of this course, through the aid of which you may avail yourself of this &#x201C;better way&#x201D; of promoting yourself.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id4x6hryl6u">Thousands of people walked over the great Calumet Copper Mine without discovering it. Just one lone man used his &#x201C;imagination,&#x201D; dug down into the earth a few feet, investigated, and discovered the richest copper deposit on earth.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id8jjtibxh8">You and every other person walk, at one time or another, over your &#x201C;Calumet Mine.&#x201D; Discovery is a matter of investigation and use of &#x201C;imagination.&#x201D; This course on the Fifteen Laws of Success may lead the way to your &#x201C;Calumet,&#x201D; and you may be surprised when you discover that you were standing right over this rich mine, in the work in which you are now engaged. In his lecture on &#x201C;Acres of Diamonds,&#x201D; Russell Conwell tells us that we need not seek opportunity in the distance; that we may find it right where we stand! THIS IS A TRUTH WELL WORTH REMEMBERING!</p><p class="SignatureSig" id="idqtxmwdh9k">&#x2014;NAPOLEON HILL</p><p class="Section-Front-Matter-GeneralSFM" id="idrqxvtlm0o">Front Matter General</p><p class="TitleTtl" id="iddludmyrip">The Author&#x2019;s Acknowledgment of Help Rendered Him in the Writing of This Course</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id3ya09whgt">This course is the result of careful analysis of the life-work of over one hundred men and women who have achieved unusual success in their respective callings.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9n6ddtoho">The author of the course has been more than twenty years in gathering, classifying, testing and organizing the Fifteen Laws upon which the course is based. In his labor he has received valuable assistance either in person or by studying the life-work of the following men:</p><p class="Unnum-Level-1-ListUl1" id="idxefp6kfkx">Henry Ford</p><p class="Unnum-Level-1-ListUl1" id="idfgbwnm1c1">Thomas A.

With many of them he enjoys, or did enjoy before their death, the privilege of close personal friendship which enabled him to gather from their philosophy facts that would not have been available under other conditions.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idqpbp054n9">The author is grateful for having enjoyed the privilege of enlisting the services of the most powerful men on earth, in the building of the Law of Success course. That privilege has been remuneration enough for the work done, if nothing more were ever received for it.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1jk7z1mvw">These men have been the back-bone and the foundation and the skeleton of American business, finance, industry and statesmanship.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id6vmdj4ikn">The Law of Success course epitomizes the philosophy and the rules of procedure which made each of these men a great power in his chosen field of endeavor. It has been the author&#x2019;s intention to present the course in the plainest and most simple terms available, so it could be mastered by very young men and young women, of the high-school age.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idk1ih5fxjx">With the exception of the psychological law referred to in the Introduction as the &#x201C;Master Mind,&#x201D; the author lays no claim to having created anything basically new in this course. What he has done, however, has been to organize old truths and known laws into PRACTICAL, USABLE FORM, where they may be properly interpreted and applied by the workaday man whose needs call for a philosophy of simplicity.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idxr422smi2">In passing upon the merits of the Law of Success Judge Elbert H. Gary said: &#x201C;Two outstanding features connected with the philosophy impress me most. One is the simplicity with which it has been presented, and the other is the fact that its soundness is so obvious to all that it will be immediately accepted.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idztukhg6vc">The student of this course is warned against passing judgment upon it before having read the entire fifteen lessons. This especially applies to this Introduction, in which it has been necessary to include brief reference to subjects of a more or less technical and scientific nature. The reason for this will be obvious after the student has read the entire fifteen lessons.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id6rrri42l9">The student who takes up this course with an open mind, and sees to it that his or her mind remains &#x201C;open&#x201D; until the last lesson shall have been read, will be richly rewarded with a broader and more accurate view of life as a whole.</p><p class="Section-Front-Matter-GeneralSFM" id="idc3moefv5q">Front Matter General</p><p class="TitleTtl" id="id2sbyp75wv">Contents of Introduction: the Master Mind</p><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="iddbukor1ft"><span class="boldb">1. </span>POWER&#x2014;what it is and how to create and use it.</p><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idpj3xnr1ir"><span class="boldb">2. </span>CO-OPERATION&#x2014;the psychology of co-operative effort and how to use it constructively.</p><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idmdscp7i3r"><span class="boldb">3. </span>THE MASTER MIND&#x2014;how it is created through harmony of purpose and effort, between two or more people.</p><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idh8y3w7j2y"><span class="boldb">4. </span>HENRY FORD, THOMAS A.

Harmony is based upon understanding of the forces constituting one&#x2019;s environment; therefore, this course is in reality a blueprint that may be followed straight to success, because it helps the student to interpret, understand and make the most of these environmental forces of life.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idwejxy6r40">Before you begin reading the Law of Success lessons you should know something of the history of the course. You should know exactly what the course promises to those who follow it until they have assimilated the laws and principles upon which it is based. You should know its limitations as well as its possibilities as an aid in your fight for a place in the world.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idk9k7xsvrj">From the viewpoint of entertainment the Law of Success course would be a poor second for most any of the monthly periodicals of the &#x201C;Snappy Story&#x201D; variety which may be found upon the newsstands of today.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idj910nl6sb">The course has been created for the serious-minded person who devotes at least a portion of his or her time to the business of succeeding in life. The author of the Law of Success course has not intended to compete with those who write purely for the purpose of entertaining.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ido0psgx1mb">The author&#x2019;s aim, in preparing this course, has been of a two-fold nature, namely, first&#x2014;to help the earnest student find out what are his or her weaknesses, and, secondly&#x2014;to help create a DEFINITE PLAN for bridging those weaknesses.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idgsikaxr9y">The most successful men and women on earth have had to correct certain weak spots in their personalities before they began to succeed. The most outstanding of these weaknesses which stand between men and women and success are INTOLERANCE, CUPIDITY, GREED, JEALOUSY, SUSPICION, REVENGE, EGOTISM, CONCEIT, THE TENDENCY TO REAP WHERE THEY HAVE NOT SOWN, and the HABIT OF SPENDING MORE THAN THEY EARN.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idkv5otdymj">All of these common enemies of mankind, and many more not here mentioned, are covered by the Law of Success course in such a manner that any person of reasonable intelligence may master them with but little effort or inconvenience.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idgul6xmn25">You should know, at the very outset, that the Law of Success course has long since passed through the experimental state; that it already has to its credit a record of achievement that is worthy of serious thought and analysis. You should know, also, that the Law of Success course has been examined and endorsed by some of the most practical minds of this generation.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iduinf4dfhf">The Law of Success course was first used as a lecture, and was delivered by its author in practically every city and in many of the smaller localities, throughout the United States, over a period of more than seven years. Perhaps you were one of the many hundreds of thousands of people who heard this lecture.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id6vhx7n1z2">During these lectures the author had assistants located in the audiences for the purpose of interpreting the reaction of those who heard the lecture, and in this manner he learned exactly what effect it had upon people. As a result of this study and analysis many changes were made.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id5naex24bq">The first big victory was gained for the Law of Success philosophy when it was used by the author as the basis of a course with which 3,000 men and women were trained as a sales army. The majority of these people were without previous experience, of any sort, in the field of selling. Through this training they were enabled to earn more than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) for themselves and paid the author $30,000.00 for his services, covering a period of approximately six months.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id3e4bj7qi6">The individuals and small groups of salespeople who have found success through the aid of this course are too numerous to be mentioned in this Introduction, but the number is large and the benefits they derived from the course were definite.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id5th68s8zy">The Law of Success philosophy was brought to the attention of the late Don R. Mellett, former publisher of the Canton (Ohio) <span class="itali">Daily</span> <span class="itali">News,</span> who formed a partnership with the author of the course and was preparing to resign as publisher of the Canton <span class="itali">Daily</span> <span class="itali">News</span> and take up the business management of the author&#x2019;s affairs when he was assassinated on July 16, 1926.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1qzzaep1b">Prior to his death Mr. Mellett had made arrangements with Judge Elbert H. Gary, who was then Chairman of the Board of the United States Steel Corporation, to present the Law of Success course to every employee of the Steel Corporation, at a total cost of something like $150,000.00. This plan was halted because of Judge Gary&#x2019;s death, but it proves that the author of the Law of Success has produced an educational plan of an enduring nature. Judge Gary was eminently prepared to judge the value of such a course, and the fact that he analyzed the Law of Success philosophy and was preparing to invest the huge sum of $150,000.00 in it is proof of the soundness of all that is said in behalf of the course.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id4btjp937h">You will observe, in this General Introduction to the course, a few technical terms which may not be plain to you. Do not allow this to bother you. Make no attempt at first reading to understand these terms. They will be plain to you after you read the remainder of the course. This entire Introduction is intended only as a background for the other fourteen lessons of the course, and you should read it as such. You will not be examined on this Introduction, but you should read it many times, as you will get from it at each reading a thought or an idea which you did not get on previous readings.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idtn2zn0k62">In this Introduction you will find a description of a newly discovered law of psychology which is the very foundation stone of all outstanding personal achievements. This law has been referred to by the author as the &#x201C;Master Mind,&#x201D; meaning a mind that is developed through the harmonious co-operation of two or more people who ally themselves for the purpose of accomplishing any given task.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idab8zzv1tb">If you are engaged in the business of selling you may profitably experiment with this law of the &#x201C;Master Mind&#x201D; in your daily work. It has been found that a group of six or seven salespeople may use the law so effectively that their sales may be increased to unbelievable proportions.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id020g8tykj">Life Insurance is supposed to be the hardest thing on earth to sell. This ought not to be true, with an established necessity such as life insurance, but it is. Despite this fact, a small group of men working for the Prudential Life Insurance Company, whose sales are mostly small policies, formed a little friendly group for the purpose of experimenting with the law of the &#x201C;Master Mind,&#x201D; with the result that every man in the group wrote more insurance during the first three months of the experiment than he had ever written in an entire year before.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idebeb8hx99">What may be accomplished through the aid of this principle, by any small group of intelligent life-insurance salesmen who have learned how to apply the law of the &#x201C;Master Mind&#x201D; will stagger the imagination of the most highly optimistic and imaginative person.</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="idty0rw3vc3">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="idlxgpbgxmj">No man has a chance to enjoy permanent success until he begins to look in a mirror for the real cause of all his mistakes</p><p class="Epigraph-SourceEpisrc" id="idfw0qh88sg">&#x2014;Napoleon Hill</p><p class="ENDEND" id="idr8xwvz7m2">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idz2694d0l8">The same may be said of other groups of salespeople who are engaged in selling merchandise and other more tangible forms of service than life insurance. Bear this in mind as you read this Introduction to the Law of Success course and it is not unreasonable to expect that this Introduction, alone, may give you sufficient understanding of the law to change the entire course of your life.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idgts88psxa">It is the personalities back of a business which determine the measure of success the business will enjoy. Modify those personalities so they are more pleasing and more attractive to the patrons of the business and the business will thrive. In any of the great cities of the United States one may purchase merchandise of similar nature and price in scores of stores, yet you will find there is always one outstanding store which does more business than any of the others, and the reason for this is that back of that store is a man, or men, who has attended to the personalities of those who come in contact with the public. People buy personalities as much as merchandise, and it is a question if they are not influenced more by the personalities with which they come in contact than they are by the merchandise.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idofywenwls">Life insurance has been reduced to such a scientific basis that the cost of insurance does not vary to any great extent, regardless of the company from which one purchases it, yet out of the hundreds of life insurance companies doing business less than a dozen companies do the bulk of the business of the United States.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9fzwd71wo">Why? Personalities! Ninety-nine people out of every hundred who purchase life insurance policies do not know what is in their policies and, what seems more startling, do not seem to care. What they really purchase is the pleasing personality of some man or woman who knows the value of cultivating such a personality.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ida8b3bp1ei">Your business in life, or at least the most important part of it, is to achieve success. Success, within the meaning of that term as covered by this course on the Fifteen Laws of Success, is &#x201C;the attainment of your Definite Chief Aim without violating the rights of other people.&#x201D; Regardless of what your major aim in life may be, you will attain it with much less difficulty after you learn how to cultivate a pleasing personality and after you have learned the delicate art of allying yourself with others in a given undertaking without friction or envy.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iduoglfl2dq">One of the greatest problems of life, if not, in fact, the greatest, is that of learning the art of harmonious negotiation with others. This course was created for the purpose of teaching people how to negotiate their way through life with harmony and poise, free from the destructive effects of disagreement and friction which bring millions of people to misery, want and failure every year.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idzz4jacpqg">With this statement of the purpose of the course you should be able to approach the lessons with the feeling that a complete transformation is about to take place in your personality.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id38prf7abk">You cannot enjoy outstanding success in life without power, and <span class="itali">you</span> <span class="itali">can</span> <span class="itali">never</span> <span class="itali">enjoy</span> <span class="itali">power</span> <span class="itali">without</span> <span class="itali">sufficient</span> <span class="itali">personality</span> <span class="itali">to</span> <span class="itali">influence</span> <span class="itali">other</span> <span class="itali">people</span> <span class="itali">to</span> <span class="itali">co-operate</span> <span class="itali">with</span> <span class="itali">you</span> <span class="itali">in</span> <span class="itali">a</span> <span class="itali">spirit</span> <span class="itali">of</span> <span class="itali">harmony.</span> This course shows you step by step how to develop such a personality.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1e6abur8o">Lesson by lesson, the following is a statement of that which you may expect to receive from the Fifteen Laws of Success:</p><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idoeq3bptq1"><span class="boldb">1</span><span class="boldb">. </span>A DEFINITE CHIEF AIM will teach you how to save the wasted effort which the majority of people expend in trying to find their life-work. This lesson will show you how to do away forever with aimlessness and fix your heart and hand upon some definite, well conceived purpose as a life-work.</p><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="id6egos9afd"><span class="boldb">2</span><span class="boldb">. </span>SELF-CONFIDENCE will help you master the six basic fears with which every person is cursed&#x2014;the fear of Poverty, the fear of Ill Health, the fear of Old Age, the fear of Criticism, the fear of Loss of Love of Someone and the fear of Death. It will teach you the difference between egotism and real self-confidence which is based upon definite, usable knowledge.</p><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idhr47tj6re"><span class="boldb">3</span><span class="boldb">. </span>THE HABIT OF SAVING will teach you how to distribute your income systematically so that a definite percentage of it will steadily accumulate, thus forming one of the greatest known sources of personal power. No one may succeed in life without saving money. There is no exception to this rule, and no one may escape it.</p><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idad89d5ku3"><span class="boldb">4</span><span class="boldb">. </span>INITIATIVE AND LEADERSHIP will show you how to become a leader instead of a follower in your chosen field of endeavor. It will develop in you the instinct for leadership which will cause you gradually to gravitate to the top in all undertakings in which you participate.</p><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idwocv2kkim"><span class="boldb">5.</span><span class="boldb"> </span>IMAGINATION will stimulate your mind so that you will conceive new ideas and develop new plans which will help you in attaining the object of your Definite Chief Aim. This lesson will teach you how to &#x201C;build new houses out of old stones,&#x201D; so to speak. It will show you how to create new ideas out of old, well known concepts, and how to put old ideas to <span class="itali">new</span> <span class="itali">uses.</span> This one lesson, alone, is the equivalent of a very practical course in salesmanship, and it is sure to prove a veritable gold mine of knowledge to the person who is in earnest.</p><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="id4vzsjihj4"><span class="boldb">6</span><span class="boldb">. </span>ENTHUSIASM will enable you to &#x201C;saturate&#x201D; all with whom you come in contact with interest in you and in your ideas. Enthusiasm is the foundation of a Pleasing Personality, and you must have such a personality in order to influence others to co-operate with you.</p><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="id43ch8y9hm"><span class="boldb">7</span><span class="boldb">. </span>SELF-CONTROL is the &#x201C;balance wheel&#x201D; with which you control your enthusiasm and direct it where you wish it to carry you. This lesson will teach you, in a most practical manner, to become &#x201C;the master of your fate, the Captain of your Soul.&#x201D;</p><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idi1iz4mid9"><span class="boldb">8</span><span class="boldb">. </span>THE HABIT OF DOING MORE THAN PAID FOR is one of the most important lessons of the Law of Success course. It will teach you how to take advantage of the Law of Increasing Returns, which will eventually insure you a return in money far out of proportion to the service you render. No one may become a real leader in any walk of life without practicing the habit of doing more work and better work than that for which he is paid.</p><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="id2h5rshc8d"><span class="boldb">9</span><span class="boldb">. </span>PLEASING PERSONALITY is the &#x201C;fulcrum&#x201D; on which you must place the &#x201C;crow-bar&#x201D; of your efforts, and when so placed, with intelligence, it will enable you to remove mountains of obstacles. This one lesson, alone, has made scores of Master Salesmen. It has developed leaders over night. It will teach you how to transform your personality so that you may adapt yourself to any environment, or to any other personality, in such a manner that you may easily dominate.</p><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idzfxpk7q4h"><span class="boldb">10</span><span class="boldb">. </span>ACCURATE THOUGHT is one of the important foundation stones of all enduring success. This lesson teaches you how to separate &#x201C;facts&#x201D; from mere &#x201C;information.&#x201D; It teaches you how to organize known facts into two classes: the &#x201C;important&#x201D; and the &#x201C;unimportant.&#x201D; It teaches you how to determine what is an &#x201C;important&#x201D; fact. It teaches you how to build definite working plans, in the pursuit of any calling, out of FACTS.</p><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idqeu7ph54u"><span class="boldb">11</span><span class="boldb">. </span>CONCENTRATION teaches you how to focus your attention upon one subject at a time until you have worked out practical plans for mastering that subject. It will teach you how to ally yourself with others in such a manner that you may have the use of their entire knowledge to back you up in your own plans and purposes. It will give you a practical working knowledge of the forces around you, and show you how to harness and use these forces in furthering your own interests.</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="id468nftb32">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="idi4h92qlzp">If you must slander someone don&#x2019;t speak it&#x2014;but write it&#x2014;write it in the sand, near the water&#x2019;s edge!</p><p class="Epigraph-SourceEpisrc" id="idfkoo5px9f">&#x2014;Napoleon Hill</p><p class="ENDEND" id="id08lud4msu">END</p><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="id43pytb0ll"><span class="boldb">12</span><span class="boldb">. </span>CO-OPERATION will teach you the value of team-work in all you do. In this lesson you will be taught how to apply the law of the &#x201C;Master Mind&#x201D; described in this Introduction and in Lesson One of this course. This lesson will show you how to co-ordinate your own efforts with those of others, in such a manner that friction, jealousy, strife, envy and cupidity will be eliminated. You will learn how to make use of all that other people have learned about the work in which you are engaged.</p><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idikklc7ynq"><span class="boldb">13</span><span class="boldb">.</span> Profiting by FAILURE will teach you how to make stepping stones out of all of your past and future mistakes and failures. It will teach you the difference between &#x201C;failure&#x201D; and &#x201C;temporary defeat,&#x201D; a difference which is very great and very important. It will teach you how to profit by your own failures and by the failures of other people.</p><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idem3f0fmr1"><span class="boldb">14</span><span class="boldb">. </span>TOLERANCE will teach you how to avoid the disastrous effects of racial and religious prejudices which mean defeat for millions of people who permit themselves to become entangled in foolish argument over these subjects, thereby poisoning their own minds and closing the door to reason and investigation. This lesson is the twin sister of the one on ACCURATE THOUGHT, for the reason that no one may become an Accurate Thinker without practicing tolerance. Intolerance closes the book of Knowledge and writes on the cover, &#x201C;Finis! I have learned it all!&#x201D; Intolerance makes enemies of those who should be friends. It destroys opportunity and fills the mind with doubt, mistrust and prejudice.</p><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idkh8kb1fkx"><span class="boldb">15</span><span class="boldb">. </span>Practicing THE GOLDEN RULE will teach you how to make use of this great universal law of human conduct in such a manner that you may easily get harmonious cooperation from any individual or group of individuals. Lack of understanding of the law upon which the Golden Rule philosophy is based is one of the major causes of failure of millions of people who remain in misery, poverty and want all their lives.

This knowledge is of two classes&#x2014;mental and physical.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idqo12sdlby">Among the useful knowledge organized by man, he has discovered and catalogued the eighty-odd physical elements of which all material forms in the universe consist.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idae4hs1agp">By study and analysis and accurate measurements man has discovered the &#x201C;bigness&#x201D; of the material side of the universe as represented by planets, suns and stars, some of which are known to be over ten million times as large as the little earth on which he lives.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idev42py1xh">On the other hand, man has discovered the &#x201C;littleness&#x201D; of the physical forms which constitute the universe by reducing the eighty-odd physical elements to molecules, atoms, and, finally, to the smallest particle, the electron. An electron cannot be seen; it is but a center of force consisting of a positive or a negative. The electron is the beginning of everything of a physical nature.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id496dphtxm"><span class="cs-headcshd">Molecules, Atoms and Electrons: </span>To understand both the detail and the perspective of the process through which knowledge is gathered, organized and classified, it seems essential for the student to begin with the smallest and simplest particles of physical matter, because these are the ABC&#x2019;s with which Nature has constructed the entire frame-work of the physical portion of the universe.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1f0u43qm1">The molecule consists of atoms, which are said to be little invisible particles of matter revolving continuously with the speed of lightning, on exactly the same principle that the earth revolves around the sun.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idl8dfd9ejq">These little particles of matter known as atoms, which revolve in one continuous circuit, in the molecule, are said to be made up of electrons, the smallest particles of physical matter. As already stated, the electron is nothing but two forms of force. The electron is uniform, of but one class, size and nature; thus in a grain of sand or a drop of water the entire principle upon which the whole universe operates is duplicated.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idf9uyyz1xk">How marvelous! How stupendous! You may gather some slight idea of the magnitude of it all the next time you eat a meal, by remembering that every article of food you eat, the plate on which you eat it, the tableware and the table itself are, in final analysis, but a collection of ELECTRONS.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idwomcb6dz3">In the world of physical matter, whether one is looking at the largest star that floats through the heavens or the smallest grain of sand to be found on earth, the object under observation is but an organized collection of molecules, atoms and electrons revolving around one another at inconceivable speed.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idcnhws9ynu">Every particle of physical matter is in a continuous state of highly agitated motion. Nothing is ever still, although nearly all physical matter may appear, to the physical eye, to be motionless. There is no &#x201C;solid&#x201D; physical matter. The hardest piece of steel is but an organized mass of revolving molecules, atoms and electrons. Moreover, the electrons in a piece of steel are of the same nature, and move at the same rate of speed as the electrons in gold, silver, brass or pewter.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idrp6eo1kk8">The eighty-odd forms of physical matter appear to be different from one another, and they are different, because they are made up of different combinations of atoms (although the electrons in these atoms are always the same, except that some electrons are positive and some are negative, meaning that some carry a positive charge of electrification while others carry a negative charge).</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="id8askwzxtm">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="id8djqxdteq">Don&#x2019;t be afraid of a little opposition.

The eighty-odd elements are created through and by reason of combining and changing of the positions of the atoms. To illustrate the modus operandi of chemistry through which this change of atomic position is wrought, in terms of modern science:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idsnr6zah1e">&#x201C;Add four electrons (two positive and two negative) to the hydrogen atom, and you have the element lithium; knock out of the lithium atom (composed of three positive and three negative electrons) one positive and one negative electron, and you have one atom of helium (composed of two positive and two negative electrons).&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idb5c64vml1">Thus it may be seen that the eighty-odd physical elements of the universe differ from one another only in the number of electrons composing their atoms, and the number and arrangement of those atoms in the molecules of each element.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id3bist9iq0">As an illustration, an atom of mercury contains eighty positive charges (electrons) in its nucleus, and eighty negative outlying charges (electrons). If the chemist were to expel two of its positive electrons it would instantly become the metal known as platinum. If the chemist could then go a step further and take from it a negative (&#x201C;planetary&#x201D;) electron, the mercury atom would then have lost two positive electrons and one negative; that is, one positive charge on the whole; hence it would retain seventy-nine positive charges in the nucleus and seventy-nine outlying negative electrons, thereby becoming GOLD!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id29djb0utg">The formula through which this electronic change might be produced has been the object of diligent search by the alchemists all down the ages, and by the modern chemists of today.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idyhcm4bz1h">It is a fact known to every chemist that literally tens of thousands of synthetic substances may be composed out of only four kinds of atoms, viz.: hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and carbon.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idf5qd7wpod">&#x201C;Differences in the number of electrons in atoms confer upon them qualitative (chemical) differences, though all atoms of any one element are chemically alike. Differences in the number and spacial arrangement of these atoms (in groups of molecules) constitute both physical and chemical differences in substances, <span class="itali">i.e.</span>, in compounds. Quite different substances are produced by combinations of precisely the same kinds of atoms, but in different proportions.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddndi3jfgh">&#x201C;Take from a molecule of certain substances one single atom, and they may be changed from a compound necessary to life and growth into a deadly poison. Phosphorus is an element, and thus contains but one kind of atoms; but some phosphorus is yellow and some is red, varying with the spacial distribution of the atoms in the molecules composing the phosphorus.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idcawqj6hm4">It may be stated as a literal truth that the atom is the universal partical with which Nature builds all material forms, from a grain of sand to the largest star that floats through space. The atom is Nature&#x2019;s &#x201C;building block&#x201D; out of which she erects an oak tree or a pine, a rock of sandstone or granite, a mouse or an elephant.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idi4xuq7a8s">Some of the ablest thinkers have reasoned that the earth on which we live, and every material particle on the earth, began with two atoms which attached themselves to each other, and through hundreds of millions of years of flight through space, kept contacting and accumulating other atoms until, step by step, the earth was formed. This, they point out, would account for the various and differing strata of the earth&#x2019;s substances, such as the coal beds, the iron ore deposits, the gold and silver deposits, the copper deposits, etc.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1fsd4fhvh">They reason that, as the earth whirled through space, it contacted groups of various kinds of nebul&#xE6;, or atoms, which it promptly appropriated, through the law of magnetic attraction. There is much to be seen, in the earth&#x2019;s surface composition, to support this theory, although there may be no positive evidence of its soundness.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idxnqdby200">These facts concerning the smallest analyzable particles of matter have been briefly referred to as a starting point from which we shall undertake to ascertain how to develop and apply the law of POWER.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idy3dda4aur">It has been noticed that all matter is in a constant state of vibration or motion; that the molecule is made up of rapidly moving particles called atoms, which, in turn, are made up of rapidly moving particles called electrons.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idawqk7y31e"><span class="cs-headcshd">The Vibrating Fluid of Matter: </span>In every particle of matter there is an invisible &#x201C;fluid&#x201D; or force which causes the atoms to circle around one another at an inconceivable rate of speed.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idsx6w94jcx">This &#x201C;fluid&#x201D; is a form of energy which has never been analyzed. Thus far it has baffled the entire scientific world. By many scientists it is believed to be the same energy as that which we call electricity. Others prefer to call it vibration. It is believed by some investigators that the rate of speed with which this force (call it whatever you will) moves determines to a large extent the nature of the outward visible appearance of the physical objects of the universe.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id0tmw0raa4">One rate of vibration of this &#x201C;fluid energy&#x201D; causes what is known as sound. The human ear can detect only the sound which is produced through from 32,000 to 38,000 vibrations per second.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id6t3g2iztx">As the rate of vibrations per second increases above that which we call sound they begin to manifest themselves in the form of heat. Heat begins with about 1,500,000 vibrations per second.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ids5ea4abua">Still higher up the scale vibrations begin to register in the form of light. 3,000,000 vibrations per second create violet light. Above this number vibration sheds ultra-violet rays (which are invisible to the naked eye) and other invisible radiations.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idhouh0uuio">And, still higher up the scale&#x2014;just how high no one at present seems to know&#x2014;vibrations create the power with which man THINKS.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id6fanfpmgk">It is the belief of the author that the &#x201C;fluid&#x201D; portion of all vibration, out of which grow all known forms of energy, is universal in nature; that the &#x201C;fluid&#x201D; portion of sound is the same as the &#x201C;fluid&#x201D; portion of light, the difference in effect between sound and light being only a difference in rate of vibration, also that the &#x201C;fluid&#x201D; portion of thought is exactly the same as that in sound, heat and light, excepting the number of vibrations per second.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idyqqads7i3">Just as there is but one form of physical matter, of which the earth and all the other planets&#x2014;suns and stars&#x2014;are composed&#x2014;the electron&#x2014;so is there but one form of &#x201C;fluid&#x201D; energy, which causes all matter to remain in a constant state of rapid motion.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idjx1qhbfhu"><span class="cs-headcshd">Air and Ether: </span>The vast space between the suns, moons, stars and other planets of the universe is filled with a form of energy known as ether. It is this author&#x2019;s belief that the &#x201C;fluid&#x201D; energy which keeps all particles of matter in motion is the same as the universal &#x201C;fluid&#x201D; known as ether which fills all the space of the universe. Within a certain distance of the earth&#x2019;s surface, estimated by some to be about fifty miles, there exists what is called air, which is a gaseous substance composed of oxygen and nitrogen. Air is a conductor of sound vibrations, but a non-conductor of light and the higher vibrations, which are carried by the ether. The ether is a conductor of all vibrations from sound to thought.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idd0awkxsdh">Air is a localized substance which performs, in the main, the service of feeding all animal and plant life with oxygen and nitrogen, without which neither could exist. Nitrogen is one of the chief necessities of plant life and oxygen one of the mainstays of animal life. Near the top of very high mountains the air becomes very light, because it contains but little nitrogen, which is the reason why plant life cannot exist there. On the other hand, the &#x201C;light&#x201D; air found in high altitudes consists largely of oxygen, which is the chief reason why tubercular patients are sent to high altitudes.</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="idojekrubec">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="idiwic08xi9">Render more service than that for which you are paid and you will soon be paid for more than you render.

You are seriously engaged in finding out what are your available powers and how to organize and apply these powers. To complete this discovery successfully you must combine determination, persistency and a well defined DESIRE to gather and organize knowledge.</p><p class="Blank-Space-BreakBsbrk" id="idrzvjx61y1">[blank]</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idv9zommiml">The late Dr. Alexander Graham Bell, inventor of the long distance telephone and one of the accepted authorities on the subject of vibration, is here introduced in support of this author&#x2019;s theories concerning the subject of vibration:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id0ukcownkj">&#x201C;Suppose you have the power to make an iron rod vibrate with any desired frequency in a dark room. At first, when vibrating slowly, its movement will be indicated by only one sense, that of touch. As soon as the vibrations increase, a low sound will emanate from it and it will appeal to two senses.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id6jupvsim7">&#x201C;At about 32,000 vibrations to the second the sound will be loud and shrill, but at 40,000 vibrations it will be silent and the movements of the rod will not be perceived by touch. Its movements will be perceived by no ordinary human sense.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idqw2s2ngy3">&#x201C;From this point up to about 1,500,000 vibrations per second, we have no sense that can appreciate any effect of the intervening vibrations. After that stage is reached, movement is indicated first by the sense of temperature and then, when the rod becomes red hot, by the sense of sight. At 3,000,000 it sheds violet light. Above that it sheds ultra-violet rays and other invisible radiations, some of which can be perceived by instruments and employed by us.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idr5pyivzjj">&#x201C;Now it has occurred to me that there must be a great deal to be learned about the effect of those vibrations in the great gap where the ordinary human senses are unable to hear, see or feel the movement. The power to send wireless messages by ether vibrations lies in that gap, but the gap is so great that it seems there must be much more. You must make machines practically to supply new senses, as the wireless instruments do.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idwh4xa3uzz">&#x201C;Can it be said, when you think of that great gap, that there are not many forms of vibrations that may give us results as wonderful as, or even more wonderful than, the wireless waves? It seems to me that in this gap lie the vibrations which we have assumed to be given off by our brains and nerve cells when we think. But then, again, they may be higher up, in the scale beyond the vibrations that produce the ultra-violet rays. <span class="smallcapssc">[Author&#x2019;s Note: </span>The last sentence suggests the theory held by this author.]</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idmerzdsslk">&#x201C;Do we need a wire to carry these vibrations? Will they not pass through the ether without a wire, just as the wireless waves do? How will they be perceived by the recipient? Will he hear a series of signals or will he find that another man&#x2019;s thoughts have entered into his brain?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id3c6gufjuu">&#x201C;We may indulge in some speculations based on what we know of the wireless waves, which, as I have said, are all we can recognize of a vast series of vibrations which theoretically must exist. If the thought waves are similar to the wireless waves, they must pass from the brain and flow endlessly around the world and the universe. The body and the skull and other solid obstacles would form no obstruction to their passage, as they pass through the ether which surrounds the molecules of every substance, no matter how solid and dense.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iduc8mxkkrd">&#x201C;You ask if there would not be constant interference and confusion if other people&#x2019;s thoughts were flowing through our brains and setting up thoughts in them that did not originate with ourselves?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1mg0v6swv">&#x201C;How do you know that other men&#x2019;s thoughts are not interfering with yours now? I have noticed a good many phenomena of mind disturbances that I have never been able to explain. For instance, there is the inspiration or the discouragement that a speaker feels in addressing an audience. I have experienced this many times in my life and have never been able to define exactly the physical causes of it.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id7mv2djctj">&#x201C;Many recent scientific discoveries, in my opinion, point to a day not far distant perhaps, when men will read one another&#x2019;s thoughts, when thoughts will be conveyed directly from brain to brain without intervention of speech, writing or any of the present known methods of communication.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ide9zrytxtz">&#x201C;It is not unreasonable to look forward to a time when we shall see without eyes, hear without ears and talk without tongues.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id77i1q3cc3">&#x201C;Briefly, the hypothesis that mind can communicate directly with mind rests on the theory that thought or vital force is a form of electrical disturbance, that it can be taken up by induction and transmitted to a distance either through a wire or simply through the all-pervading ether, as in the case of wireless telegraph waves.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id0lu77t5p6">&#x201C;There are many analogies which suggest that thought is of the nature of an electrical disturbance. A nerve, which is of the same substance as the brain, is an excellent conductor of the electric current. When we first passed an electrical current through the nerves of a dead man we were shocked and amazed to see him sit up and move. The electrified nerves produced contraction of the muscles very much as in life.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idcsgdcg7w9">&#x201C;The nerves appear to act upon the muscles very much as the electric current acts upon an electro-magnet. The current magnetizes a bar of iron placed at right angles to it, and the nerves produce, through the intangible current of vital force that flows through them, contraction of the muscular fibers that are arranged at right angles to them.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idphh39qu4j">&#x201C;It would be possible to cite many reasons why thought and vital force may be regarded as of the same nature as electricity. The electric current is held to be a wave motion of the ether, the hypothetical substance that fills all space and pervades all substances. We believe that there must be ether because without it the electric current could not pass through a vacuum, or sunlight through space. It is reasonable to believe that only a wave motion of a similar character can produce the phenomena of thought and vital force. We may assume that the brain cells act as a battery and that the current produced flows along the nerves.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9p2k2366c">&#x201C;But does it end there? Does it not pass out of the body in waves which flow around the world unperceived by our senses, just as the wireless waves passed unperceived before Hertz and others discovered their existence?&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idu40k1n4et"><span class="cs-headcshd">Every Mind Both a Broadcasting and a Receiving Station: </span>This author has proved, times too numerous to enumerate, to his own satisfaction at least, that every human brain is both a broadcasting and a receiving station for vibrations of thought frequency.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idsuh74imem">If this theory should turn out to be a fact, and methods of reasonable control should be established, imagine the part it would play in the gathering, classifying and organizing of knowledge. The possibility, much less the probability, of such a reality, staggers the mind of man!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ido26yslaw8">Thomas Paine was one of the great minds of the American Revolutionary Period. To him more, perhaps, than to any other one person, we owe both the beginning and the happy ending of the Revolution, for it was his keen mind that both helped in drawing up the Declaration of Independence and in persuading the signers of that document to translate it into terms of reality.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idamuvptjtn">In speaking of the source of his great storehouse of knowledge, Paine thus described it:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ido1g3uxlze">&#x201C;Any person, who has made observations on the state of progress of the human mind, by observing his own, cannot but have observed that there are two distinct classes of what are called Thoughts: those that we produce in ourselves by reflection and the act of thinking, and those that bolt into the mind of their own accord. I have always made it a rule to treat these voluntary visitors with civility, taking care to examine, as well as I was able, if they were worth entertaining; and it is from them I have acquired almost all the knowledge that I have. As to the learning that any person gains from school education, it serves only like a small capital, to put him in the way of beginning learning for himself afterwards. Every person of learning is finally his own teacher, the reason for which is, that principles cannot be impressed upon the memory; their place of mental residence is the understanding, and they are never so lasting as when they begin by conception.&#x201D;</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="idurpyaaedv">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="idaikususl5">Every failure is a blessing in disguise, providing it teaches some needed lesson one could not have learned without it.

Who is there so unfortunate as not to have received positive evidence that thoughts and even complete ideas will &#x201C;pop&#x201D; into the mind from outside sources?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ido6mfikbmf">What means of conveyance is there for such visitors except the ether? Ether fills the boundless space of the universe. It is the medium of conveyance for all known forms of vibration such as sound, light and heat. Why should it not be, also, the medium of conveyance of the vibration of Thought?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idmjbcneuaw">Every mind, or brain, is directly connected with every other brain by means of the ether. Every thought released by any brain may be instantly picked up and interpreted by all other brains that are &#x201C;en rapport&#x201D; with the sending brain. This author is as sure of this fact as he is that the chemical formula H<span class="subsub">2</span>O will produce water. Imagine, if you can, what a part this principle plays in every walk of life.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id6p49gazik">Nor is the probability of ether being a conveyor of thought from mind to mind the most astounding of its performances. It is the belief of this author that every thought vibration released by any brain is picked up by the ether and kept in motion in circuitous wave lengths corresponding in length to the intensity of the energy used in their release; that these vibrations remain in motion forever; that they are one of the two sources from which thoughts which &#x201C;pop&#x201D; into one&#x2019;s mind emanate, the other source being direct and immediate contact through the ether with the brain releasing the thought vibration.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idf6pew4evp">Thus it will be seen that if this theory is a fact the boundless space of the whole universe is now and will continue to become literally a mental library wherein may be found all the thoughts released by mankind.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9blz5gziy">The author is here laying the foundation for one of the most important hypotheses enumerated in the lesson Self-confidence, a fact which the student should keep in mind as he approaches that lesson.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idvhjqj74oj">This is a lesson on Organized Knowledge. Most of the useful knowledge to which the human race has become heir has been preserved and accurately recorded in Nature&#x2019;s Bible.

The evidence is plain and unmistakable. The great stone pages of Nature&#x2019;s Bible found on this earth and the endless pages of that Bible represented by the ether wherein all past human thought has been recorded, constitute an authentic source of communication between the Creator and man.

Nature&#x2019;s Bible, from which we have derived all the knowledge that is worth knowing, is one that no man may alter or in any manner tamper with.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idyzyrlkbu9">The most marvelous discovery yet made by man is that of the recently discovered radio principle, which operates through the aid of ether, an important portion of Nature&#x2019;s Bible. Imagine the ether picking up the ordinary vibration of sound, and transforming that vibration from audio-frequency into radio-frequency, carrying it to a properly attuned receiving station and there transforming it back into its original form of audio-frequency, all in the flash of a second. It should surprise no one that such a force could gather up the vibration of thought and keep that vibration in motion forever.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id77ajj5s38">The established and known fact of instantaneous transmission of sound, through the agency of the ether, by means of the modern radio apparatus, removes the theory of transmission of thought vibration from mind to mind from the possible to the probable.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idtxv3iofg9"><span class="cs-headcshd">The Master Mind: </span>We come, now, to the next step in the description of the ways and means by which one may gather, classify and organize useful knowledge, through harmonious alliance of two or more minds, out of which grows a Master Mind.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idgr8to1nvz">The term &#x201C;Master Mind&#x201D; is abstract, and has no counterpart in the field of known facts, except to a small number of people who have made a careful study of the effect of one mind upon other minds.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idh722wveck">This author has searched in vain through all the textbooks and essays available on the subject of the human mind, but nowhere has been found even the slightest reference to the principle here described as the &#x201C;Master Mind.&#x201D; The term first came to the attention of the author through an interview with Andrew Carnegie, in the manner described in Lesson One.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idnjdbvsow7"><span class="cs-headcshd">Chemistry of the Mind: </span>It is this author&#x2019;s belief that the mind is made up of the same universal &#x201C;fluid&#x201D; energy as that which constitutes the ether which fills the universe. It is a fact as well known to the layman as to the man of scientific investigation, that some minds clash the moment they come in contact with each other, while other minds show a natural affinity for each other. Between the two extremes of natural antagonism and natural affinity growing out of the meeting or contacting of minds there is a wide range of possibility for varying reactions of mind upon mind.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idxxmr8wz84">Some minds are so naturally adapted to each other that &#x201C;love at first sight&#x201D; is the inevitable outcome of the contact. Who has not known of such an experience? In other cases minds are so antagonistic that violent mutual dislike shows itself at first meeting. These results occur without a word being spoken, and without the slightest signs of any of the usual causes for love and hate acting as a stimulus.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id5yjbd7x6c">It is quite probable that the &#x201C;mind&#x201D; is made up of a fluid or substance or energy, call it what you will, similar to (if not in fact the same substance as) the ether. When two minds come close enough to each other to form a contact, the mixing of the units of this &#x201C;mind stuff&#x201D; (let us call it the electrons of the ether) sets up a chemical reaction and starts vibrations which affect the two individuals pleasantly or unpleasantly.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idv5lhrv2zg">The effect of the meeting of two minds is obvious to even the most casual observer. Every effect must have a cause! What could be more reasonable than to suspect that the cause of the change in mental attitude between two minds which have just come in close contact is none other than the disturbance of the electrons or units of each mind in the process of rearranging themselves in the new field created by the contact?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id3t4d3pdkx">For the purpose of establishing this lesson upon a sound foundation we have gone a long way toward success by admitting that the meeting or coming in close contact of two minds sets up in each of those minds a certain noticeable &#x201C;effect&#x201D; or state of mind quite different from the one existing immediately prior to the contact. While it is desirable it is not essential to know what is the &#x201C;cause&#x201D; of this reaction of mind upon mind. That the reaction takes place, in every instance, is a known fact which gives us a starting point from which we may show what is meant by the term &#x201C;Master Mind.&#x201D;</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="id5gbw5jmxb">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="idxiobe0h00">To believe in the heroic makes heroes.</p><p class="Epigraph-SourceEpisrc" id="id02ms6eymp">&#x2014;Disraeli</p><p class="ENDEND" id="idu5h8bqiqz">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id99dv7embb">A Master Mind may be created through the bringing together or blending, in a spirit of perfect harmony, of two or more minds. Out of this harmonious blending the chemistry of the mind creates a third mind which may be appropriated and used by one or all of the individual minds. This Master Mind will remain available as long as the friendly, harmonious alliance between the individual minds exists. It will disintegrate and all evidence of its former existence will disappear the moment the friendly alliance is broken.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iduc5huiww0">This principle of mind chemistry is the basis and cause for practically all the so-called &#x201C;soul-mate&#x201D; and &#x201C;eternal triangle&#x201D; cases, so many of which unfortunately find their way into the divorce courts and meet with popular ridicule from ignorant and uneducated people who manufacture vulgarity and scandal out of one of the greatest of Nature&#x2019;s laws.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idj70h9c3gg">The entire civilized world knows that the first two or three years of association after marriage are often marked by much disagreement, of a more or less petty nature. These are the years of &#x201C;adjustment.&#x201D; If the marriage survives them it is more than apt to become a permanent alliance. These facts no experienced married person will deny. Again we see the &#x201C;effect&#x201D; without understanding the &#x201C;cause.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2hq9hbfgp">While there are other contributing causes, yet, in the main, lack of harmony during these early years of marriage is due to the slowness of the chemistry of the minds in blending harmoniously. Stated differently, the electrons or units of the energy called the mind are often neither extremely friendly nor antagonistic upon first contact; but, through constant association they gradually adapt themselves in harmony, except in rare cases where association has the opposite effect of leading, eventually, to open hostility between these units.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idh0olrde2o">It is a well known fact that after a man and a woman have lived together for ten to fifteen years they become practically indispensable to each other, even though there may not be the slightest evidence of the state of mind called love. Moreover, this association and relationship sexually not only develops a natural affinity between the two minds, but it actually causes the two people to take on a similar facial expression and to resemble each other closely in many other marked ways. Any competent analyst of human nature can easily go into a crowd of strange people and pick out the wife after having been introduced to her husband. The expression of the eyes, the contour of the faces and the tone of the voices of people who have long been associated in marriage, become similar to a marked degree.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idadis0dkhw">So marked is the effect of the chemistry of the human mind that any experienced public speaker may quickly interpret the manner in which his statements are accepted by his audience. Antagonism in the mind of but one person in an audience of one thousand may be readily detected by the speaker who has learned how to &#x201C;feel&#x201D; and register the effects of antagonism. Moreover, the public speaker can make these interpretations without observing or in any manner being influenced by the expression on the faces of those in his audience. On account of this fact an audience may cause a speaker to rise to great heights of oratory, or heckle him into failure, without making a sound or denoting a single expression of satisfaction or dissatisfaction through the features of the face.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idykds82006">All &#x201C;Master Salesmen&#x201D; know the moment the &#x201C;psychological time for closing&#x201D; has arrived; not by what the prospective buyer says, but from the effect of the chemistry of his mind as interpreted or &#x201C;felt&#x201D; by the salesman. Words often belie the intentions of those speaking them but a correct interpretation of the chemistry of the mind leaves no loophole for such a possibility. Every able salesman knows that the majority of buyers have the habit of affecting a negative attitude almost to the very climax of a sale.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idjuetqylhh">Every able lawyer has developed a sixth sense whereby he is enabled to &#x201C;feel&#x201D; his way through the most artfully selected words of the clever witness who is lying, and correctly interpret that which is in the witness&#x2019;s mind, through the chemistry of the mind. Many lawyers have developed this ability without knowing the real source of it; they possess the technique without the scientific understanding upon which it is based. Many salesmen have done the same thing.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id3o284u8m9">One who is gifted in the art of correctly interpreting the chemistry of the minds of others may, figuratively speaking, walk in at the front door of the mansion of a given mind and leisurely explore the entire building, noting all its details, walking out again with a complete picture of the interior of the building, without the owner of the building so much as knowing that he has entertained a visitor. It will be observed, in the lesson Accurate Thinking, that this principle may be put to a very practical use (having reference to the principle of the chemistry of the mind). The principle is referred to merely as an approach to the major principles of this lesson.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idrgghe1hpv">Enough has already been stated to introduce the principle of mind chemistry, and to prove, with the aid of the student&#x2019;s own every-day experiences and casual observations that the moment two minds come within close range of each other a noticeable mental change takes place in both, sometimes registering in the nature of antagonism and at other times registering in the nature of friendliness. Every mind has what might be termed an electric field. The nature of this field varies, depending upon the &#x201C;mood&#x201D; of the individual mind back of it, and upon the nature of the chemistry of the mind creating the &#x201C;field.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idlk1ye28gc">It is believed by this author that the normal or natural condition of the chemistry of any individual mind is the result of his physical heredity plus the nature of thoughts which have dominated that mind; that every mind is continuously changing to the extent that the individual&#x2019;s philosophy and general habits of thought change the chemistry of his or her mind. These principles the author BELIEVES to be true. That any individual may voluntarily change the chemistry of his or her mind so that it will either attract or repel all with whom it comes in contact is a KNOWN FACT! Stated in another manner, any person may assume a mental attitude which will attract and please others or repel and antagonize them, and this without the aid of words or facial expression or other form of bodily movement or demeanor.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idh6vwkjwtn">Go back, now, to the definition of a &#x201C;Master Mind&#x201D;&#x2014;a mind which grows out of the blending and co-ordination of two or more minds, IN A SPIRIT OF PERFECT HARMONY, and you will catch the full significance of the word &#x201C;harmony&#x201D; as it is here used. Two minds will not blend nor can they be co-ordinated unless the element of perfect harmony is present, wherein lies the secret of success or failure of practically all business and social partnerships.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idcr081pvgv">Every sales manager and every military commander and every leader in any other walk of life understands the necessity of an &#x201C;esprit de corps&#x201D;&#x2014;a spirit of common understanding and co-operation&#x2014;in the attainment of success. This mass spirit of harmony of purpose is obtained through discipline, voluntary or forced, of such a nature that the individual minds become blended into a &#x201C;Master Mind,&#x201D; by which is meant that the chemistry of the individual minds is modified in such a manner that these minds blend and function as one.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id0d0xwvc9m">The methods through which this blending process takes place are as numerous as the individuals engaged in the various forms of leadership. Every leader has his or her own method of co-ordinating the minds of the followers. One will use force. Another uses persuasion. One will play upon the fear of penalties while another plays upon rewards, in order to reduce the individual minds of a given group of people to where they may be blended into a mass mind. The student will not have to search deeply into history of statesmanship, politics, business or finance, to discover the technique employed by the leaders in these fields in the process of blending the minds of individuals into a mass mind.</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="idiuk0jh8pk">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="idgebt381rx">If you do not believe in co-operation, look what happens to a wagon that loses a wheel.</p><p class="ENDEND" id="idam0z4rfvd">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id24my1t09j">The really great leaders of the world, however, have been provided by Nature with a combination of mind chemistry favorable as a nucleus of attraction for other minds. Napoleon was a notable example of a man possessing the magnetic type of mind which had a very decided tendency to attract all minds with which it came in contact. Soldiers followed Napoleon to certain death without flinching, because of the impelling or attracting nature of his personality, and that personality was nothing more nor less than the chemistry of his mind.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idfd0c60gc9">No group of minds can be blended into a Master Mind if one of the individuals of that group possesses one of these extremely negative, repellent minds. The negative and positive minds will not blend in the sense here described as a Master Mind. Lack of knowledge of this fact has brought many an otherwise able leader to defeat.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idhbpgnwtqk">Any able leader who understands this principle of mind chemistry may temporarily blend the minds of practically any group of people, so that it will represent a mass mind, but the composition will disintegrate almost the very moment the leader&#x2019;s presence is removed from the group. The most successful life-insurance sales organizations and other sales forces meet once a week, or more often, for the purpose of&#x2014;OF WHAT?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idmukhne7pl">FOR THE PURPOSE OF MERGING THE INDIVIDUAL MINDS INTO A MASTER MIND WHICH WILL, FOR A LIMITED NUMBER OF DAYS, SERVE AS A STIMULUS TO THE INDIVIDUAL MINDS!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idla1p1g328">It may be, and generally is, true that the leaders of these groups do not understand what actually takes place in these meetings, which are usually called &#x201C;pep meetings.&#x201D; The routine of such meetings is usually given over to talks by the leader and other members of the group, and occasionally from someone outside of the group, meanwhile the minds of the individuals are contacting and recharging one another.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idhk64qtq50">The brain of a human being may be compared to an electric battery in that it will become exhausted or run down, causing the owner of it to feel despondent, discouraged and lacking in &#x201C;pep.&#x201D; Who is so fortunate as never to have had such a feeling? The human brain, when in this depleted condition, must be recharged, and the manner in which this is done is through contact with a more vital mind or minds. The great leaders understand the necessity of this &#x201C;recharging&#x201D; process, and, moreover, they understand how to accomplish this result. THIS KNOWLEDGE IS THE MAIN FEATURE WHICH DISTINGUISHES A LEADER FROM A FOLLOWER!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idq3f8swgo8">Fortunate is the person who understands this principle sufficiently well to keep his or her brain vitalized or &#x201C;recharged&#x201D; by periodically contacting it with a more vital mind. Sexual contact is one of the most effective of the stimuli through which a mind may be recharged, providing the contact is intelligently made, between man and woman who have genuine affection for each other. Any other sort of sexual relationship is a devitalizer of the mind. Any competent practitioner of Psycho-therapeutics can &#x201C;recharge&#x201D; a brain within a few minutes.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idwbehqjeq5">Before passing away from the brief reference made to sexual contact as a means of revitalizing a depleted mind it seems appropriate to call attention to the fact that all of the great leaders, in whatever walks of life they have arisen, have been and are people of highly sexed natures. (The word &#x201C;sex&#x201D; is not an indecent word. You&#x2019;ll find it in all the dictionaries.)</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idvr6rx31bi">There is a growing tendency upon the part of the best informed physicians and other health practitioners, to accept the theory that all diseases begin when the brain of the individual is in a depleted or devitalized state. Stated in another way, it is a known fact that a person who has a perfectly vitalized brain is practically, if not entirely, immune from all manner of disease.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idcay4uekfh">Every intelligent health practitioner, of whatever school or type, knows that &#x201C;Nature&#x201D; or the mind cures disease in every instance where a cure is effected. Medicines, faith, laying on of hands, chiropractic, osteopathy and all other forms of outside stimulant are nothing more than artificial aids to NATURE, or, to state it correctly, mere methods of setting the chemistry of the mind into motion to the end that it readjusts the cells and tissues of the body, revitalizes the brain and otherwise causes the human machine to function normally.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idu6veu29bq">The most orthodox practitioner will admit the truth of this statement.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ida9sti3owl">What, then, may be the possibilities of the future developments in the field of mind chemistry?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idulewed8xm">Through the principle of harmonious blending of minds perfect health may be enjoyed. Through the aid of this same principle sufficient power may be developed to solve the problem of economic pressure which constantly presses upon every individual.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idbs5qjywrg">We may judge the future possibilities of mind chemistry by taking inventory of its past achievements, keeping in mind the fact that these achievements have been largely the result of accidental discovery and of chance groupings of minds. We are approaching the time when the professorate of the universities will teach mind chemistry the same as other subjects are now taught. Meanwhile, study and experimentation in connection with this subject open vistas of possibility for the individual student.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idaa0if9wog"><span class="cs-headcshd">Mind Chemistry and Economic Power: </span>That mind chemistry may be appropriately applied to the workaday affairs of the economic and commercial world is a demonstrable fact.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ide6aflegjt">Through the blending of two or more minds, in a spirit of PERFECT HARMONY, the principle of mind chemistry may be made to develop sufficient power to enable the individuals whose minds have been thus blended to perform seemingly superhuman feats. Power is the force with which man achieves success in any undertaking. Power, in unlimited quantities, may be enjoyed by any group of men, or men and women, who possess the wisdom with which to submerge their own personalities and their own immediate individual interests, through the blending of their minds in a spirit of perfect harmony.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idu0meme889">Observe, profitably, the frequency with which the word &#x201C;harmony&#x201D; appears throughout this Introduction! There can be no development of a &#x201C;Master Mind&#x201D; where this element of PERFECT HARMONY does not exist. The individual units of the mind will not blend with the individual units of another mind UNTIL THE TWO MINDS HAVE BEEN AROUSED AND WARMED, AS IT WERE, WITH A SPIRIT OF PERFECT HARMONY OF PURPOSE. The moment two minds begin to take divergent roads of interest the individual units of each mind separate, and the third element, known as a &#x201C;MASTER MIND,&#x201D; which grew out of the friendly or harmonious alliance, will disintegrate.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id23hth91na">We come, now, to the study of some well known men who have accumulated great power (also great fortunes) through the application of mind chemistry.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id3s046yj0j">Let us begin our study with three men who are known to be men of great achievement in their respective fields of economic, business and professional endeavor.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id8r6p1756w">Their names are Henry Ford, Thomas A. Edison and Harvey S. Firestone.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idzd6l6k4zi">Of the three Henry Ford is, by far, the most POWERFUL, having reference to economic and financial power. Mr. Ford is the most powerful man now living on earth. Many who have studied Mr. Ford believe him to be the most powerful man who ever lived. As far as is known Mr. Ford is the only man now living, or who ever lived, with sufficient power to outwit the money trust of the United States. Mr. Ford gathers millions of dollars with as great ease as a child fills its bucket with sand when playing on the beach. It has been said, by those who were in position to know, that Mr. Ford, if he needed it, could send out the call for money and gather in a billion dollars (a thousand million dollars) and have it available for use within one week. No one who knows of Ford&#x2019;s achievements doubts this. Those who know him well know that he could do it with no more effort than the average man expends in raising the money with which to pay a month&#x2019;s house rent. He could get this money, if he needed it, through the intelligent application of the principles on which this course is based.</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="idg8hhlshmi">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="iddqqocfyi8">Courage is the standing army of the soul which keeps it from conquest, pillage and slavery.</p><p class="Epigraph-SourceEpisrc" id="id1t8h2y5h6">&#x2014;Henry Van Dyke</p><p class="ENDEND" id="id2rqyarv6b">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idp9s80ktcz">While Mr. Ford&#x2019;s new automobile was in the process of perfection, in 1927, it is said that he received advance orders, with cash payments, for more than 375,000 cars. At an estimated price of $600.00 per car this would amount to $225,000,000.00 which he received before a single car was delivered. Such is the power of confidence in Ford&#x2019;s ability.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idw30kg9u6n">Mr. Edison, as everyone knows, is a philosopher, scientist and inventor. He is, perhaps, the keenest Bible student on earth; a student of Nature&#x2019;s Bible, however, and not of the myriads of man-made Bibles. Mr. Edison has such a keen insight into Mother Nature&#x2019;s Bible that he has harnessed and combined, for the good of mankind, more of Nature&#x2019;s laws than any other person now living or who ever lived. It was he who brought together the point of a needle and a piece of revolving wax, in such a way that the vibration of the human voice may be recorded and reproduced through the modern talking machine.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id0llhscl31">(And it may be Edison who will eventually enable man to pick up and correctly interpret the vibrations of thought which are now recorded in the boundless universe of ether, just as he has enabled man to record and reproduce the spoken word.)</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id3p0j855t5">It was Edison who first harnessed the lightning and made it serve as a light for man&#x2019;s use, through the aid of the incandescent electric light bulb.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idollt1kocm">It was Edison who gave the world the modern moving picture.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idtn89gafif">These are but a few of his outstanding achievements. These modern &#x201C;miracles&#x201D; which he has performed (not by trickery, under the sham pretense of superhuman power, but in the very midst of the bright light of science) transcend all of the so-called &#x201C;miracles&#x201D; described in the man-made books of fiction.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idvx78rxnzm">Mr. Firestone is the moving spirit in the great Firestone Tire industry, in Akron, Ohio. His industrial achievements are so well known wherever automobiles are used that no special comment on them seems necessary.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idoza2u0oqz">All three of these men began their careers, business and professional, without capital and with but little schooling of that type usually referred to as &#x201C;education.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idfuuppks5u">All three men are now well educated. All three are wealthy. All three are powerful. Now let us inquire into the source of their wealth and power. Thus far we have been dealing only with effect; the true philosopher wishes to understand the <span class="itali">cause</span> of a given effect.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idb0w1lvqbl">It is a matter of general knowledge that Mr. Ford, Mr. Edison and Mr. Firestone are close personal friends, and have been so for many years; that in former years they were in the habit of going away to the woods once a year for a period of rest, meditation and recuperation.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idk4xs75xmw">But it is not generally known&#x2014;it is a grave doubt if these three men themselves know it&#x2014;that there exists between the three men a bond of harmony which has caused their minds to become blended into a &#x201C;Master Mind&#x201D; which is the real source of the power of each. This mass mind, growing out of the co-ordination of the individual minds of Ford, Edison and Firestone, has enabled these men to &#x201C;tune in&#x201D; on forces (and sources of knowledge) with which most men are to no extent familiar.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id4wfgys0fw">If the student doubts either the principle or the effects here described, let him remember that more than half the theory here set forth is a known fact. For example, it is known that these three men have great power. It is known that they are wealthy. It is known that they began without capital and with but little schooling. It is known that they form periodic mind contacts. It is known that they are harmonious and friendly. It is known that their achievements are so outstanding as to make it impossible to compare these achievements with those of other men in their respective fields of activity.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idni6xbxs6g">All these &#x201C;effects&#x201D; are known to practically every school-boy in the civilized world, therefore there can be no dispute as far as effects are concerned.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id8qyc0r05h">Of one fact connected with the <span class="itali">cause</span> of the achievements of Edison, Ford and Firestone we may be sure, namely, that these achievements were in no way based upon trickery, deceit, the &#x201C;supernatural&#x201D; or so-called &#x201C;revelations&#x201D; or any other form of unnatural law. These men do not possess a stock of legerdemain. They work with natural laws; laws which, for the most part, are well known to all economists and leaders in the field of science, with the possible exception of the law upon which chemistry of the mind is based. As yet chemistry of the mind is not sufficiently developed to be classed, by scientific men, in their catalogue of known laws.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idj8yynjrta">A &#x201C;Master Mind&#x201D; may be created by any group of people who will co-ordinate their minds, in a spirit of perfect harmony. The group may consist of any number from two upward. Best results appear available from the blending of six or seven minds.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idxggohgh44">It has been suggested that Jesus Christ discovered how to make use of the principle of mind chemistry, and that His seemingly miraculous performances grew out of the power He developed through the blending of the minds of His twelve disciples. It has been pointed out that when one of the disciples (Judas Iscariot) broke faith the &#x201C;Master Mind&#x201D; immediately disintegrated and Jesus met with the supreme catastrophe of His life.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idy87solkjy">When two or more people harmonize their minds and produce the effect known as a &#x201C;Master Mind,&#x201D; each person in the group becomes vested with the power to contact with and gather knowledge through the &#x201C;subconscious&#x201D; minds of all the other members of the group. This power becomes immediately noticeable, having the effect of stimulating the mind to a higher rate of vibration, and otherwise evidencing itself in the form of a more vivid imagination and the consciousness of what appears to be a sixth sense. It is through this sixth sense that new ideas will &#x201C;flash&#x201D; into the mind. These ideas take on the nature and form of the subject dominating the mind of the individual. If the entire group has met for the purpose of discussing a given subject, ideas concerning that subject will come pouring into the minds of all present, as if an outside influence were dictating them. The minds of those participating in the &#x201C;Master Mind&#x201D; become as magnets, attracting ideas and thought stimuli of the most highly organized and practical nature, from&#x2014;no one knows where!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idbpnxfatqk">The process of mind-blending here described as a &#x201C;Master Mind&#x201D; may be likened to the act of one who connects many electric batteries to a single transmission wire, thereby &#x201C;stepping up&#x201D; the power flowing over that line. Each battery added increases the power passing over that line by the amount of energy the battery carries. Just so in the case of blending individual minds into a &#x201C;Master Mind.&#x201D; Each mind, through the principle of mind chemistry, stimulates all the other minds in the group, until the mind energy thus becomes so great that it penetrates to and connects with the universal energy known as ether, which, in turn, touches every atom of the entire universe.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idizhzo7k01">The modern radio apparatus substantiates, to a considerable extent, the theory here expounded. Powerful sending or broadcasting stations must be erected through which the vibration of sound is &#x201C;stepped up&#x201D; before it can be picked up by the much higher vibrating energy of the ether and carried in all directions. A &#x201C;Master Mind&#x201D; made up of many individual minds, so blended that they produce a strong vibrating energy, constitutes almost an exact counterpart of the radio broadcasting station.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9jvk1i6ks">Every public speaker has felt the influence of mind chemistry, for it is a well known fact that as soon as the individual minds of an audience become &#x201C;en rapport&#x201D; (attuned to the rate of vibration of the mind of the speaker) with the speaker, there is a noticeable increase of enthusiasm in the speaker&#x2019;s mind, and he often rises to heights of oratory which surprise all, including himself.</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="id9t2m6x2h7">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="id9azspyssz">Men cease to interest us when we find their limitations.

It is reasonable to suppose that all vibrations which have been &#x201C;stepped up&#x201D; sufficiently to be picked up and absorbed in the ether, will go on forever. The lower vibrations, which do not blend with or otherwise contact the ether, probably live a natural life and die out.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idehacrpgcl">All the so-called geniuses probably gained their reputations because, by mere chance or otherwise, they formed alliances with other minds which enabled them to &#x201C;step up&#x201D; their own mind vibrations to where they were enabled to contact the vast Temple of Knowledge recorded and filed in the ether of the universe.

These meetings were strictly for the purpose of co-operating on the give and take basis of assisting one another with ideas and suggestions, and occasionally by endorsing notes and other securities to assist some member of the group who had met with an emergency making such help necessary.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id91p8m9hal">It is said that each of the individuals belonging to this Big Six group is a millionaire many times over.

These outstanding successes often appear to be the handiwork of but one person, but search closely and the other individuals whose minds have been co-ordinated with his own may be found.

It is impossible to estimate, with anything approximating correctness, the actual dollars and cents value of either of these two groups of assets, but it is my opinion that their relative values are:</p><p class="Unnum-Level-1-ListUl1" id="idn5u6lgiv0">&#x201C;The organized knowledge of the Ford Organization 75%</p><p class="Unnum-Level-1-ListUl1" id="idefngayufg">The value of cash and physical assets of every nature, including raw and finished materials 25%&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idqxneyrnd4">This author is of the opinion that this statement was not compiled by the young man whose name was signed to it, without the assistance of some very analytical and experienced mind or minds.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id6c8orclrh">Unquestionably the biggest asset that Henry Ford has is his own brain.

Capital is always available, in unlimited quantities, to such brains as Ford&#x2019;s.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id8q6ergp25">Ford is the most powerful man on earth (economically) because he has the keenest and most practical conception of the principle of ORGANIZED KNOWLEDGE of any man on earth, as far as this author has the means of knowing.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idyb8217dk6">Despite Ford&#x2019;s great power and financial success, it may be that he has blundered often in the application of the principles through which he accumulated this power. There is but little doubt that Ford&#x2019;s methods of mind co-ordination have often been crude; they must needs have been in the earlier days of this experience, before he gained the wisdom of application that would naturally go with maturity of years.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idw9l7rm3ht">Neither can there be much doubt that Ford&#x2019;s application of the principle of mind chemistry was, at least at the start, the result of a chance alliance with other minds, particularly the mind of Edison. It is more than probable that Mr. Ford&#x2019;s remarkable insight into the laws of nature was first begun as the result of his friendly alliance with his own wife long before he ever met either Mr. Edison or Mr. Firestone. Many a man who never knows the real source of his success is made by his wife, through application of the &#x201C;Master Mind&#x201D; principle. Mrs. Ford is a most remarkably intelligent woman, and this author has reason to believe that it was her mind, blended with Mr. Ford&#x2019;s, which gave him his first real start toward power.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idxj40o6bxf">It may be mentioned, without in any way depriving Ford of any honor or glory, that in his earlier days of experience he had to combat the powerful enemies of illiteracy and ignorance to a greater extent than did either Edison or Firestone, both of whom were gifted by natural heredity with a most fortunate aptitude for acquiring and applying knowledge. Ford had to hew this talent out of the rough, raw timbers of his hereditary estate.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id974krvxz7">Within an inconceivably short period of time Ford has mastered three of the most stubborn enemies of mankind and transformed them into assets constituting the very foundation of his success.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9jd3oygo0">These enemies are: Ignorance, illiteracy and poverty!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id0w29dej46">Any man who can stay the hand of these three savage forces, much less harness and use them to good account, is well worth close study by the less fortunate individuals.</p><p class="Blank-Space-BreakBsbrk" id="idy9pysxi4n">[blank]</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idakyr6w8zw">This is an age of INDUSTRIAL POWER in which we are living!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iduyzk6df6c">The source of all this POWER is ORGANIZED EFFORT.

The State built a highway through the land. An &#x201C;uneducated&#x201D; man who was driving his automobile over this road observed that this poor land was on top of a mountain which commanded a wonderful view for many miles in all directions. He (the ignorant one) also observed that the land was covered with a growth of small pines and other saplings. He bought fifty acres of the land for $10.00 an acre. Near the public highway he built a unique log house to which he attached a large dining room. Near the house he put in a gasoline filling station. He built a dozen single-room log houses along the road, these he rented out to tourists at $3.00 a night, each. The dining room, gasoline filling station and log houses brought him a net income of $15,000.00 the first year.

Stated differently, many well known poisonous elements are neutralized and rendered harmless when combined with certain other elements.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idahnwdg3tx">Just as the combining of certain elements changes their entire nature, the combining of certain minds changes the nature of those minds, producing either a certain degree of what has been called a &#x201C;Master Mind,&#x201D; or its opposite, which is highly destructive.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idwbqspqcp6">Any man who has found his mother-in-law to be incompatible has experienced the negative application of the principle known as a &#x201C;Master Mind.&#x201D; For some reason as yet unknown to investigators in the field of mind behavior, the majority of mothers-in-law appear to affect their daughters&#x2019; husbands in a highly negative manner, the meeting of their minds with those of their sons-in-law creating a highly antagonistic influence instead of a &#x201C;Master Mind.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2x80deo6s">This fact is too well known as a truth to make extended comment necessary.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idvs4ifpfw1">Some minds will not be harmonized and cannot be blended into a &#x201C;Master Mind,&#x201D; a fact which all leaders of men will do well to remember. It is the leader&#x2019;s responsibility so to group his men that those who have been placed at the most strategic points in his organization are made up of individuals whose minds CAN and WILL BE blended in a spirit of friendliness and harmony.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iduywdgrpnc">Ability so to group men is the chief outstanding quality of leadership. In Lesson One of this course the student will discover that this ability was the main source of both the power and fortune accumulated by the late Andrew Carnegie.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idt1jl1bk2v">Knowing nothing whatsoever of the technical end of the steel business, Carnegie so combined and grouped the men of which his &#x201C;Master Mind&#x201D; was composed that he built the most successful steel industry known to the world during his life-time.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddpfdcgg5b">Henry Ford&#x2019;s gigantic success may be traced to the successful application of this selfsame principle. With all the self-reliance a man could have, Ford, nevertheless, did not depend upon himself for the knowledge necessary in the successful development of his industries.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id7cq433jzr">Like Carnegie, he surrounded himself with men who supplied the knowledge which he, himself, did not and could not possess.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idfdqk6lonb">Moreover, Ford picked men who could and did harmonize in group effort.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idj18z5nqmn">The most effective alliances, which have resulted in the creation of the principle known as the &#x201C;Master Mind,&#x201D; have been those developed out of the blending of the minds of men and women. The reason for this is the fact that the minds of male and female will more readily blend in harmony than will the minds of males. Also, the added stimulus of sexual contact often enters into the development of a &#x201C;Master Mind&#x201D; between a man and a woman.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idos6iug6ob">It is a well known fact that the male of the species is keener and more alert for &#x201C;the chase,&#x201D; let the goal or object of the chase be what it may, when inspired and urged on by a female.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idigws1vh4w">This human trait begins to manifest itself in the male at the age of puberty, and continues throughout his life. The first evidence of it may be observed in athletics, where boys are playing before an audience made up of females.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9w68jid1o">Remove the women from the audience and the game known as football would soon become a very tame affair. A boy will throw himself into a football game with almost superhuman effort when he knows that the girl of his choice is observing him from the grandstand.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1mcvjsc09">And that same boy will throw himself into the game of accumulating money with the same enthusiasm when inspired and urged on by the woman of his choice; especially if that woman knows how to stimulate his mind with her own, through the law of the &#x201C;Master Mind.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idrlmelnov8">On the other hand, that same woman may, through a negative application of the law of the &#x201C;Master Mind&#x201D; (nagging, jealousy, selfishness, greed, vanity), drag this man down to sure defeat!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idgfc2brhbn">The late Elbert Hubbard understood the principle here described so well that when he discovered that the incompatibility between himself and his first wife was dragging him down to sure defeat he ran the gamut of public opinion by divorcing her and marrying the woman who is said to have been the main source of his inspiration.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id54ylapux0">Not every man would have had the courage to defy public opinion, as Hubbard did, but who is wise enough to say that his action was not for the best interest of all concerned?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id32mpl4lyj">A man&#x2019;s chief business in life is to succeed!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idqzt7qfybk">The road to success may be, and generally is, obstructed by many influences which must be removed before the goal can be reached. One of the most detrimental of these obstacles is that of unfortunate alliance with minds which do not harmonize. In such cases the alliance must be broken or the end is sure to be defeat and failure.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idape9x0zus">The man who has mastered the six basic fears, one of which is the Fear of Criticism, will have no hesitancy in taking what may seem to the more convention-bound type of mind to be drastic action when he finds himself circumscribed and bound down by antagonistic alliances, no matter of what nature or with whom they may be.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idvptu07qed">It is a million times better to meet and face criticism than to be dragged down to failure and oblivion on account of alliances which are not harmonious, whether the alliances be of a business or social nature.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1f08nv13t">To be perfectly frank, the author is here justifying divorce, when the conditions surrounding marriage are such that harmony cannot prevail. This is not intended to convey the belief that lack of harmony may not be removed through other methods than that of divorce; for there are instances where the cause of antagonism may be removed and harmony established without taking the extreme step of divorce.</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="idqvpd6tve9">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="id0px1bkv3y">If you cannot do great things yourself remember that you may do small things in a great way.</p><p class="ENDEND" id="idaf1r00r4z">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idrxbnetupu">While it is true that some minds will not blend in a spirit of harmony, and cannot be forced or induced to do so, because of the chemical nature of the individuals&#x2019; brains, DO NOT BE TOO READY TO CHARGE THE OTHER PARTY TO YOUR ALLIANCE WITH ALL THE RESPONSIBILITY OF LACK OF HARMONY&#x2014;REMEMBER, <span class="itali">THE</span> <span class="itali">TROUBLE</span> <span class="itali">MAY</span> <span class="itali">BE</span> <span class="itali">WITH</span> <span class="itali">YOUR</span> <span class="itali">OWN</span> <span class="itali">BRAIN!</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id0q5d4l58b">Remember, also, that a mind which cannot and will not harmonize with one person or persons may harmonize perfectly with other types of minds. Discovery of this truth has resulted in radical changes in methods of employing men. It is no longer customary to discharge a man because he does not fit in the position for which he was originally hired. The discriminating leader endeavors to place such a man in some other position, where, it has been proved more than once, misfits may become valuable men.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id50hkfyrce">The student of this course should be sure that the principle described as the &#x201C;Master Mind&#x201D; is thoroughly understood before proceeding with the remaining lessons of the course. The reason for this is the fact that practically the entire course is closely associated with this law of mind operation.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9g27ay76t">If you are not sure that you understand this law, communicate with the author of the course and secure further explanation by asking such questions as you may wish concerning points in connection with which you believe you need further information.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idx97kc8i6b">You cannot spend too much time in serious thought and contemplation in connection with the law of the &#x201C;Master Mind,&#x201D; for the reason that when you have mastered this law and have learned how to apply it new worlds of opportunity will open to you.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idlf9ijjw0j">This Introduction, while not really intended as a separate lesson of the Law of Success course, contains sufficient data to enable the student who has an aptitude for selling to become a Master Salesman.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id8k51h7ljj">Any sales organization may make effective use of the law of the &#x201C;Master Mind&#x201D; by grouping the salesmen in groups of two or more people who will ally themselves in a spirit of friendly co-operation and apply this law as suggested in this lesson.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id7o3pgyypu">An agent for a well known make of automobile, who employs twelve salesmen, has grouped his organization in six groups of two men each, with the object of applying the law of the &#x201C;Master Mind,&#x201D; with the result that all the salesmen have established new high sales records.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idqw54inctv">This same organization has created what it calls the &#x201C;One-A-Week Club,&#x201D; meaning that each man belonging to the Club has averaged the sale of one car a week since the Club was organized.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idub07zpeel">The results of this effort have been surprising to all!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idcmslmuhnn">Each man belonging to the Club was provided with a list of 100 prospective purchasers of automobiles. Each salesman sends one postal card a week to each of his 100 prospective purchasers, and makes personal calls on at least ten of these each day.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idn35oju8b1">Each postal card is confined to the description of but one advantage of the automobile the salesman is selling, and asks for a personal interview.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idada210z59">Interviews have increased rapidly, as have, also, sales!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idu3xxnxgdj">The agent who employs these salesmen has offered an extra cash bonus to each salesman who earns the right to membership in the &#x201C;One-A-Week Club&#x201D; by averaging one car a week.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iduvxo34m0o">The plan has injected new vitality into the entire organization. Moreover, the results of the plan are showing in the weekly sales record of each salesman.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idmmpwbp1yg">A similar plan could be adopted very effectively by Life Insurance Agencies. Any enterprising General Agent might easily double or even triple the volume of his business, with the same number of salesmen, through the use of this plan.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idaqxeppt2o">Practically no changes whatsoever would need to be made in the method of use of the plan. The Club might be called the &#x201C;Policy-A-Week Club,&#x201D; meaning that each member pledged himself to sell at least one policy, of an agreed minimum amount, each week.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idqn7vq3sp4">The student of this course who has mastered the first lesson, and understands how to apply the fundamentals of that lesson (A Definite Chief Aim) will be able to make much more effective use of the plan here described.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id8jigxvfm8">It is not suggested or intended that any student shall undertake to apply the principles of this Introduction, until he has mastered at least the next five lessons of the Law of Success course.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idljcpmx00g">The main purpose of this Introduction is to state some of the principles upon which the course is founded.

If he had, no one would have believed him.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idurwql2d0f">As you read about these ugly characters analyze yourself and find out which of them does YOU the most damage!</p><p class="Blank-Space-BreakBsbrk" id="iduk3cy6tx4">[blank]</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2cu95jl00">The purpose of this essay is to help the readers of this course throw off these deadly enemies. Observe that the six characters are at your back, where you cannot conveniently see them.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idxnk4q5ju2">Every human being on this earth is bound down to some extent by one or more of these unseen FEARS. The first step to be taken in killing off these enemies is to find out where and how you acquired them.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idb74d4xjv4">They got their grip upon you through two forms of heredity. One is known as physical heredity, to which Darwin devoted so much study. The other is known as social heredity, through which the fears, superstitions and beliefs of men who lived during the dark ages have been passed on from one generation to another.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idysse55spk">Let us study, first, the part that physical heredity has played in creating these six BASIC FEARS. Starting at the beginning, we find that Nature has been a cruel builder. From the lowest form of life to the highest, Nature has permitted the stronger to prey upon the weaker forms of animal life.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idzqg0r5euy">The fish prey upon the worms and insects, eating them bodily. Birds prey upon the fish. Higher forms of animal life prey upon the birds, and upon one another, all the way up the line to man. And, man preys upon all the other lower forms of animal life, and upon MAN!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idwnqtnan01">The whole story of evolution is one unbroken chain of evidence of cruelty and destruction of the weaker by the stronger. No wonder the weaker forms of animal life have learned to FEAR the stronger. The Fear consciousness is born in every living animal.</p><p class="Blank-Space-BreakBsbrk" id="idvzzswepzi">[blank]</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idp0nhv4tfv">So much for the FEAR instinct that came to us through physical heredity. Now let us examine social heredity, and find out what part it has played in our make-up. The term &#x201C;social heredity&#x201D; has reference to everything that we are taught, everything we learn or gather from observation and experience with other living beings.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idaxgpmtxk4">Lay aside any prejudices and fixed opinions you may have formed, at least temporarily, and you may know the truth about your Six Worst Enemies, starting with:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idy96dc00d0"><span class="cs-headcshd">The Fear of Poverty! </span>It requires courage to tell the truth about the history of this enemy of mankind, and still greater courage to hear the truth after it has been told. The Fear of Poverty grows out of man&#x2019;s habit of preying upon his fellow men, economically. The animals which have instinct, but no power to THINK, prey upon one another physically. Man, with his superior sense of intuition, and his more powerful weapon of THOUGHT, does not eat his fellow man bodily; he gets more pleasure from eating him FINANCIALLY.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idl2iqqr1dj">So great an offender is man, in this respect, that nearly every state and nation has been obliged to pass laws, scores of laws, to protect the weak from the strong. Every blue-sky law is indisputable evidence of man&#x2019;s nature to prey upon his weaker brother economically.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idbt1bq56yt">The second of the Six Basic Fears with which man is bound down is:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idgx4lj51ke"><span class="cs-headcshd">The Fear of Old Age! </span>This Fear grows out of two major causes. First, the thought that Old Age may bring with it POVERTY. Secondly, from false and cruel sectarian teachings which have been so well mixed with fire and brimstone that every human being learned to Fear Old Age because it meant the approach of another and, perhaps, a more horrible world than this.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idxzc8fzz73">The third of the Six Basic Fears is:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idpqh77oslz"><span class="cs-headcshd">The Fear of Ill Health: </span>This Fear is born of both physical and social heredity. From birth until death there is eternal warfare within every physical body; warfare between groups of cells, one group being known as the friendly builders of the body, and the other as the destroyers, or &#x201C;disease germs.&#x201D; The seed of Fear is born in the physical body, to begin with, as the result of Nature&#x2019;s cruel plan of permitting the stronger forms of cell life to prey upon the weaker. Social heredity has played its part through lack of cleanliness and knowledge of sanitation. Also, through the law of suggestion cleverly manipulated by those who profited by ILL HEALTH.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ids6xfd5nee">The fourth of the Six Basic Fears is:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idd0i0o8diw"><span class="cs-headcshd">The Fear of Loss of Love of Someone: </span>This Fear fills the asylums with the insanely jealous, for jealousy is nothing but a form of insanity. It also fills the divorce courts and causes murders and other forms of cruel punishment. It is a holdover, handed down through social heredity, from the stone age when man preyed upon his fellow man by stealing his mate by physical force. The method, but not the practice, has now changed to some extent. Instead of physical force man now steals his fellow man&#x2019;s mate with pretty colorful ribbons and fast motor cars and bootleg whisky, and sparkling rocks and stately mansions.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idd0tpmyej2">Man is improving. He now &#x201C;entices&#x201D; where once he &#x201C;drove.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idsmslvsi34">The fifth of the Six Basic Fears is:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idrdv9a7du7"><span class="cs-headcshd">The Fear of Criticism: </span>Just how and where man got this Fear is difficult to determine, but it is certain that he has it. But for this Fear men would not become bald-headed. Bald heads come from tightly fitting hat-bands, which cut off the circulation from the roots of the hair. Women seldom are bald because they wear loose fitting hats. But for Fear of Criticism man would lay aside his hat and keep his hair.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idn56yrkhbd">The makers of clothing have not been slow to capitalize this Basic Fear of mankind. Every season the styles change, because the clothes makers know that few people have the courage to wear a garment that is one season out of step with what &#x201C;They are all wearing.&#x201D; If you doubt this (you gentlemen) start down the street with last year&#x2019;s narrow-brimmed straw hat on, when this year&#x2019;s style calls for the broad brim. Or (you ladies), take a walk down the street on Easter morning with last year&#x2019;s hat on. Observe how uncomfortable you are, thanks to your unseen enemy, the FEAR OF CRITICISM.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idp7yo8a4x2">The sixth and last of the Six Basic Fears is the most dreaded of them all. It is called:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idfcqv4ylbx"><span class="cs-headcshd">The Fear of Death! </span>For tens of thousands of years man has been asking the still unanswered questions&#x2014;&#x201C;WHENCE?&#x201D; and &#x201C;WHITHER?&#x201D; The more crafty of the race have not been slow to offer the answer to this eternal question, &#x201C;Where did I come from and where am I going after Death?&#x201D; &#x201C;Come into my tent,&#x201D; says one leader, &#x201C;and you may go to Heaven after Death.&#x201D; Heaven was then pictured as a wonderful city whose streets were lined with gold and studded with precious stones. &#x201C;Remain out of my tent and you may go straight to hell.&#x201D; Hell was then pictured as a blazing furnace where the poor victim might have the misery of burning forever in brimstone.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id11ecxgxse">No wonder mankind FEARS DEATH!</p><p class="Blank-Space-BreakBsbrk" id="idppqor6ow7">[blank]</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idffoblbrs0">Take another look at the picture at the beginning of this essay and determine, if you can, which of the Six Basic Fears is doing you the greatest damage. An enemy discovered is an enemy half whipped.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idyuycr5gia">Thanks to the schools and colleges man is slowly discovering these Six Enemies. The most effective tool with which to fight them is ORGANIZED KNOWLEDGE. Ignorance and Fear are twin sisters. They are generally found together.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ida149wyl59">But for IGNORANCE and SUPERSTITION the Six Basic Fears would disappear from man&#x2019;s nature in one generation. In every public library may be found the remedy for these six enemies of mankind, providing you know what books to read.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ideuacgrbon">Begin by reading <span class="itali">The</span> <span class="itali">Science</span> <span class="itali">of</span> <span class="itali">Power</span>, by Benjamin Kidd, and you will have broken the strangle hold of most of your Six Basic Fears. Follow this by reading Emerson&#x2019;s essay on Compensation. Then select some good book on auto-suggestion (self-suggestion) and inform yourself on the principle through which your beliefs of today become the realities of tomorrow. <span class="itali">Mind</span> <span class="itali">in</span> <span class="itali">the</span> <span class="itali">Making</span>, by Robinson, will give you a good start toward understanding your own mind.</p><p class="Blank-Space-BreakBsbrk" id="id42lcvli5m">[blank]</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idr6c1uvib7">Through the principle of social heredity the IGNORANCE and SUPERSTITION of the dark ages have been passed on to you. But, you are living in a modern age. On every hand you may see evidence that every EFFECT has a natural CAUSE. Begin, now, to study effects by their causes and soon you will emancipate your mind from the burden of the Six Basic Fears.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idrfqgoh0d1">Begin by studying men who have accumulated great wealth, and find out the CAUSE of their achievements. Henry Ford is a good subject to start with. Within the short period of twenty-five years he has whipped POVERTY and made himself the most powerful man on earth. There was no luck or chance or accident back of his achievement. It grew out of his careful observation of certain principles which are as available to you as they were to him.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idct8gbyvhb">Henry Ford is not bound down by the Six Basic Fears; make no mistake about this.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idx4rm2dakw">If you feel that you are too far away from Ford to study him accurately, then begin by selecting two people whom you know close at hand; one representing your idea of FAILURE and the other corresponding to your idea of SUCCESS. Find out what made one a failure and the other a success. Get the real FACTS. In the process of gathering these facts you will have taught yourself a great lesson on CAUSE and EFFECT.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idsj1h823e8">Nothing ever just &#x201C;happens.&#x201D; Everything, from the lowest animal form that creeps on the earth or swims in the seas, on up to man, is the EFFECT of Nature&#x2019;s evolutionary process. Evolution is &#x201C;orderly change.&#x201D; No &#x201C;miracles&#x201D; are connected with this orderly change.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idn521ga82j">Not only do the physical shapes and colors of animals undergo slow, orderly change from one generation to another, but the mind of man is also undergoing constant change. Herein lies your hope for improvement. You have the power to force your mind through a process of rather quick change. In a single month of properly directed self-suggestion you may place your foot upon the neck of every one of your Six Basic Fears. In twelve months of persistent effort you may drive the entire herd into the corner where it will never again do you any serious injury.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idv1vhfihot">You will resemble, tomorrow, the DOMINATING THOUGHTS that you keep alive in your mind today! Plant in your mind the seed of DETERMINATION to whip your Six Basic Fears and the battle will have been half won then and there. Keep this intention in your mind and it will slowly push your Six Worst Enemies out of sight, as they exist nowhere except in your own mind.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idodsn0cm8j">The man who is powerful FEARS nothing; not even God. The POWERFUL man loves God, but FEARS Him never! Enduring power never grows out of FEAR. Any power that is built upon FEAR is bound to crumble and disintegrate. Understand this great truth and you will never be so unfortunate as to try to raise yourself to power through the FEARS of other people who may owe you temporary allegiance.</p><p class="EXTRACT-AEXT-A" id="id3s0do107m">EXTRACT-A</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idhtkm8soa0">One of the most destructive evils is slanderous talk.

Others are here stated for the first time. It should be kept in mind, from the first lesson to the last, that the value of the philosophy lies entirely in the thought stimuli it will produce in the mind of the student, and not merely in the lessons themselves.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idowsk5ctz8">Stated in another way, this course is intended as a mind stimulant that will cause the student to organize and direct to a DEFINITE end the forces of his or her mind, thus harnessing the stupendous power which most people waste in spasmodic, purposeless thought.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idlwpkozgtw">Singleness of purpose is essential for success, no matter what may be one&#x2019;s idea of the definition of success.

It was observed that he did not rely entirely upon one form of exercise, but resorted to many forms. The punching bag helped him develop one set of muscles, and also trained his eye to be quick. The dumb-bells trained still another set of muscles. Running developed the muscles of his legs and hips. A well balanced food ration supplied the materials needed for building muscle without fat. Proper sleep, relaxation and rest habits provided still other qualities which he must have in order to win.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idl6t0j3sq1">The student of this course is, or should be, engaged in the business of training for success in the battle of life. To win there are many factors which must have attention. A well organized, alert and energetic mind is produced by various and sundry stimuli, all of which are plainly described in these lessons.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idvmftrj3h6">It should be remembered, however, that the mind requires, for its development, a variety of exercise, just as the physical body, to be properly developed, calls for many forms of systematic exercise.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id7zadayov4">Horses are trained to certain gaits by trainers who hurdle-jump them over handicaps which cause them to develop the desired steps, through habit and repetition. The human mind must be trained in a similar manner, by a variety of thought-inspiring stimuli.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id0jpx21hdt">You will observe, before you have gone very far into this philosophy, that the reading of these lessons will superinduce a flow of thoughts covering a wide range of subjects. For this reason the student should read the course with a note-book and pencil at hand, and follow the practice of recording these thoughts or &#x201C;ideas&#x201D; as they come into the mind.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idsrcle8z6r">By following this suggestion the student will have a collection of ideas, by the time the course has been read two or three times, sufficient to transform his or her entire life-plan.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1uj2e54ek">By following this practice it will be noticed, very soon, that the mind has become like a magnet in that it will attract useful ideas right out of the &#x201C;thin air,&#x201D; to use the words of a noted scientist who has experimented with this principle for a great number of years.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id8bfo31ig3">You will do yourself a great injustice if you undertake this course with even a remote feeling that you do not stand in need of more knowledge than you now possess.

It has stuck in my crop ever since. And now I am going to pass it along.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idtgif95wax">&#x201C;&#x2018;A certain Greenland Eskimo,&#x2019; said Lomen, &#x2018;was taken on one of the American North Polar expeditions a number of years ago. Later, as a reward for faithful service, he was brought to New York City for a short visit. At all the miracles of sight and sound he was filled with a most amazed wonder. When he returned to his native village he told stories of buildings that rose into the very face of the sky; of street cars, which he described as houses that moved along the trail, with people living in them as they moved; of mammoth bridges, artificial lights, and all the other dazzling concomitants of the metropolis.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idsjrwgidsh">&#x201C;&#x2018;His people looked at him coldly and walked away. And forthwith throughout the whole village he was dubbed &#x201C;Sagdluk,&#x201D; meaning &#x201C;the Liar,&#x201D; and this name he carried in shame to his grave. Long before his death his original name was entirely forgotten.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ido5xrvae5d">&#x201C;&#x2018;When Knud Rasmussen made his trip from Greenland to Alaska he was accompanied by a Greenland Eskimo named Mitek (Eider Duck). Mitek visited Copenhagen and New York, where he saw many things for the first time and was greatly impressed. Later, upon his return to Greenland, he recalled the tragedy of Sagdluk, and decided that it would not be wise to tell the truth. Instead, he would narrate stories that his people could grasp, and thus save his reputation.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idnuvu2kukp">&#x201C;&#x2018;So he told them how he and Doctor Rasmussen maintained a kayak on the banks of a great river, the Hudson, and how, each morning, they paddled out for their hunting. Ducks, geese and seals were to be had a-plenty, and they enjoyed the visit immensely.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idic5dgv03o">&#x201C;&#x2018;Mitek, in the eyes of his countrymen, is a very honest man.

If you doubt this statement, then master these fifteen lessons so you can go about the analysis with reasonable accuracy and analyze such men as Carnegie, Rockefeller, Hill, Harriman, Ford and others of this type who have accumulated great fortunes of material wealth, and you will see that they understood and applied the principle of <span class="itali">organized</span> <span class="itali">effort</span> which runs, like a golden cord of indisputable evidence, throughout this course.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idnyipks18b">Nearly twenty years ago I interviewed Mr. Carnegie for the purpose of writing a story about him.

No one person in this group is the master mind of which I speak, but the sum total of the minds in the group, co-ordinated, organized and directed to a <span class="itali">definite</span> end in a spirit of harmonious co-operation is the power that got my money for me.

The steel business in which that mind was engaged was but an incident in connection with the accumulation of the Carnegie wealth. The same wealth could have been accumulated had the &#x201C;Master Mind&#x201D; been directed in the coal business or the banking business or the grocery business, for the reason that back of the mind was <span class="itali">power</span>&#x2014;that sort of power which <span class="itali">you</span> may have when you shall have organized the faculties of your own mind and allied yourself with other well organized minds for the attainment of a <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">chief</span> <span class="itali">aim</span> in life.</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="iduz3xuso43">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="id2qb9pltwk">If you can run a losing race without blaming your loss on someone else, you have bright prospects of success further down the road in life.</p><p class="ENDEND" id="idyn9rxd6ld">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id6cm0xd08f">A careful check-up with several of Mr. Carnegies former business associates, which was made after this course was begun, proves conclusively not only that there is such a law as that which has been called the &#x201C;Master Mind,&#x201D; but that this law was the chief source of Mr. Carnegie&#x2019;s success.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idsjnwdjxll">Perhaps no man was ever associated with Mr. Carnegie who knew him better than did Mr. C. M. Schwab. In the following words Mr. Schwab has very accurately described that &#x201C;subtle something&#x201D; in Mr. Carnegie&#x2019;s personality which enabled him to rise to such stupendous heights.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddshp9lm6j">&#x201C;I never knew a man with so much imagination, lively intelligence and instinctive comprehension. You sensed that he probed your thoughts and took stock of everything that you had ever done or might do. He seemed to catch at your next word before it was spoken. The play of his mind was dazzling and his habit of close observation gave him a store of knowledge about innumerable matters.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idrkl6b2tqz">&#x201C;But his outstanding quality, from so rich an endowment, was the power of inspiring other men. Confidence radiated from him. You might be doubtful about something and discuss the matter with Mr. Carnegie. In a flash he would make you see that it was right and then absolutely believe it; or he might settle your doubts by pointing out its weakness. This quality of attracting others, then spurring them on, arose from his own strength.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idjkhi1og3g">&#x201C;The results of his leadership were remarkable. Never before in history of industry, I imagine, was there a man who, without understanding his business in its working details, making no pretense of technical knowledge concerning steel or engineering, was yet able to build up such an enterprise.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idzsrxztguo"><span class="itali">&#x201C;Mr.</span> <span class="itali">Carnegie&#x2019;s</span> <span class="itali">ability</span> <span class="itali">to</span> <span class="itali">inspire</span> <span class="itali">men</span> <span class="itali">rested</span> <span class="itali">on</span> <span class="itali">something</span> <span class="itali">deeper</span> <span class="itali">than</span> <span class="itali">any</span> <span class="itali">faculty</span> <span class="itali">of</span> <span class="itali">judgment.&#x201D;</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idq02yftmrh">In the last sentence Mr. Schwab has conveyed a thought which corroborates the theory of the &#x201C;Master Mind&#x201D; to which the author of this course has attributed the chief source of Mr. Carnegie&#x2019;s power.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idmxumzzn3c">Mr. Schwab has also confirmed the statement that Mr. Carnegie could have succeeded as well in any other business as he did in the steel business. It is obvious that his success was due to his understanding of his own mind and the minds of other men, and not to mere knowledge of the steel business itself.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idof5bmjzb8">This thought is most consoling to those who have not yet attained outstanding success, for it shows that success is solely a matter of correctly applying laws and principles which are available to all; and these laws, let us not forget, are fully described in the Fifteen Lessons of this course.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idiqvgkte5o">Mr. Carnegie learned how to apply the law of the &#x201C;Master Mind.&#x201D; This enabled him to organize the faculties of his own mind and the faculties of other men&#x2019;s minds, and coordinate the whole behind a DEFINITE CHIEF AIM.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id6fad0pqhl">Every strategist, whether in business or war or industry or other callings, understands the value of <span class="itali">organized,</span> co-ordinated effort. Every military strategist understands the value of sowing seeds of dissension in the ranks of the opposing forces, because this breaks up the power of co-ordination back of the opposition. During the late world war much was heard about the effects of propaganda, and it seems not an exaggeration to say that the disorganizing forces of propaganda were much more destructive than were all the guns and explosives used in the war.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idb3xz6m2kv">One of the most important turning-points of the world war came when the allied armies were placed under the direction of the French General, Foch. There are well informed military men who claim that this was the move which spelled doom for the opposing armies.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idv48wxst6c">Any modern railroad bridge is an excellent example of the value of <span class="itali">organized</span> <span class="itali">effort,</span> because it demonstrates quite simply and clearly how thousands of tons of weight may be borne by a comparatively small group of steel bars and beams so arranged that the weight is spread over the entire group.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idrx2ka85eu">There was a man who had seven sons who were always quarreling among themselves. One day he called them together and informed them that he wished to demonstrate just what their lack of co-operative effort meant. He had prepared a bundle of seven sticks which he had carefully tied together. One by one he asked his sons to take the bundle and break it. Each son tried, but in vain. Then he cut the strings and handed one of the sticks to each of his sons and asked him to break it over his knee. After the sticks had all been broken, with ease, he said:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idsqkzpe4dn">&#x201C;When you boys work together in a spirit of harmony you resemble the bundle of sticks, and no one can defeat you; but when you quarrel among yourselves anyone can defeat you one at a time.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ids6gqf51ej">There is a worth-while lesson in this story of the man and his seven quarrelsome sons, and it may be applied to the people of a community, the employees and employers in a given place of employment, or to the state and nation in which we live.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idi9o6mcezb"><span class="itali">Organized</span> <span class="itali">effort</span> may be made a power, but it may also be a dangerous power unless guided with intelligence, which is the chief reason why the fifteenth lesson of this course is devoted largely to describing how to direct the power of organized effort so that it will lead to <span class="itali">success;</span> that sort of success which is founded upon truth and justice and fairness that lead to ultimate <span class="itali">happiness.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idz0jailerl">One of the outstanding tragedies of this age of struggle and money-madness is the fact that so few people are engaged in the effort which they like best. One of the objects of this course is to help each student find his or her particular niche in the world&#x2019;s work, where both material prosperity and <span class="itali">happiness</span> in abundance may be found. For this purpose a Character Analysis Chart accompanies the Introduction. This chart is designed to help the student take inventory of himself and find out what latent ability and hidden forces lie sleeping within him.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id62da9habr">This entire course is intended as a stimulus with which to enable you to see yourself and your hidden forces as they are, and to awaken in you the ambition and the vision and the determination to cause you to go forth and claim that which is rightfully yours.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ids1vha29fx">Less than thirty years ago a man was working in the same shop with Henry Ford, doing practically the same sort of work that he was doing. It has been said that this man was really a more competent workman, in that particular sort of work, than Ford. Today this man is still engaged in the same sort of work, at wages of less than a hundred dollars a week, while Mr. Ford is the world&#x2019;s richest man.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idwo9jmbuuq">What outstanding difference is there between these two men which has so widely separated them in terms of material wealth? Just this&#x2014;Ford understood and applied the principle of <span class="itali">organized</span> <span class="itali">effort</span> while the other man did not.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id911cqj8qp">In the little city of Shelby, Ohio, as these lines are being written, for the first time in the history of the world this principle of <span class="itali">organized</span> <span class="itali">effort</span> is being applied for the purpose of bringing about a closer alliance between the churches and the business houses of a community.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idxbahj3lds">The clergymen and business men have formed an alliance, with the result that practically every church in the city is squarely back of every business man, and every business man is squarely back of every church. The effect has been the strengthening of the churches and the business houses to such an extent that it has been said that it would be practically impossible for any individual member of either class to fail in his calling. The others who belong to the alliance will permit no such failures.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idm63keg67b">Here is an example of what may happen when groups of men form an alliance for the purpose of placing the combined power of the group back of each individual unit. The alliance has brought both material and moral advantages to the city of Shelby such as are enjoyed by but few other cities of its size in America. The plan has worked so effectively and so satisfactorily that a movement is now under way to extend it into other cities throughout America.</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="ideit1ik9am">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="idjk7ft7vr7">A GOOD Encyclopaedia contains most of the known facts of the world, but they are as useless as Sand Dunes until organized and expressed in terms of action.</p><p class="ENDEND" id="id8xd4x8pu2">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idhfhdcjnz4">That you may gain a still more concrete vision of just how this principle of <span class="itali">organized</span> <span class="itali">effort</span> can be made powerful, stop for a moment and allow your imagination to draw a picture of what would likely be the result if every church and every newspaper and every Rotary Club and every Kiwanis Club and every Advertising Club and every Woman&#x2019;s Club and every other civic organization of a similar nature, in your city, or in any other city in the United States, should form an alliance for the purpose of pooling their power and using it for the benefit of all members of these organizations.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idw1q83sdlr">The results which might easily be attained by such an alliance stagger the imagination!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id4xei256u1">There are three outstanding powers in the world of <span class="itali">organized</span> <span class="itali">effort.</span> They are: The churches, the schools and the newspapers. Think what might easily happen if these three great powers and molders of public opinion should ally themselves together for the purpose of bringing about any needed change in human conduct. They could, in a single generation, so modify the present standard of business ethics, for example, that it would practically be business suicide for anyone to try to transact business under any standard except that of the Golden Rule. Such an alliance could be made to produce sufficient influence to change, in a single generation, the business, social and moral tendencies of the entire civilized world. Such an alliance would have sufficient power to <span class="itali">force</span> upon the minds of the oncoming generations any ideals desired.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id229o1s1tw">Power is <span class="itali">organized</span> <span class="itali">effort,</span> as has already been stated!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idcq1cbcn24">Success is based upon power!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idjg7zz3sis">That you may have a clear conception of what is meant by the term &#x201C;organized effort&#x201D; I have made use of the foregoing illustrations, and for the sake of further emphasis I am going to repeat the statement that the accumulation of great wealth and the attainment of any high station in life such as constitute what we ordinarily call <span class="itali">success,</span> are based upon the vision to comprehend and the ability to assimilate and apply the major principles of the fifteen lessons of this course.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id461xbcgfo">This course is in complete harmony with the principles of economics and the principles of Applied Psychology. You will observe that those lessons, which depend, for their practical application, upon knowledge of psychology, have been supplemented with sufficient explanation of the psychological principles involved to render the lessons easily understood.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idxbfjiaynx">Before the manuscripts for this course went to the publisher they were submitted to some of the foremost bankers and business men of America, that they might be examined, analyzed and criticized by the most practical type of mind. One of the best known bankers in New York City returned the manuscripts with the following comment:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idq54p3vouh">&#x201C;I hold a master&#x2019;s degree from Yale, but I would willingly exchange all that this degree has brought me in return for what your course on the Law of Success would have brought me had I been afforded the privilege of making it a part of my training while I was studying at Yale.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id69mk4qbny">&#x201C;My wife and daughter have also read the manuscripts, and my wife has named your course &#x2018;the master key-board of life&#x2019; because she believes that all who understand how to apply it may play a perfect symphony in their respective callings, just as a pianist may play any tune when once the key-board of the piano and the fundamentals of music have been mastered.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idqqa9v4l6d">No two people on earth are exactly alike, and for this reason no two people would be expected to attain from this course the same viewpoint. Each student should read the course, understand it and then appropriate from its contents whatever he or she needs to develop a well-rounded personality.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idvimzkh4tr">This course has been compiled for the purpose of helping the student find out what are his or her natural talents, and for the purpose of helping organize, co-ordinate and put into use the knowledge gained from experience. For more than twenty years I have been gathering, classifying and organizing the material that has gone into the course. During the past fourteen years I have analyzed more than 16,000 men and women, and all of the vital facts gathered from these analyses have been carefully organized and woven into this course. These analyses brought out many interesting facts which have helped to make this course practical and usable. For example, it was discovered that ninety-five per cent of all who were analyzed were failures, and but five per cent were successes. (By the term &#x201C;failure&#x201D; is meant that they had failed to find happiness and the ordinary necessities of life without struggle that was almost unbearable.) Perhaps this is about the proportion of successes and failures that might be found if all the people of the world were accurately analyzed. The struggle for a mere existence is terrific among people who have not learned how to organize and direct their natural talents, while the attainment of those necessities, as well as the acquiring of many of the luxuries, is comparatively simple among those who have mastered the principle of <span class="itali">organized</span> <span class="itali">effort.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id88pw5canb">One of the most startling facts brought to light by those 16,000 analyses was the discovery that the ninety-five per cent who were classed as failures were in that class <span class="itali">because</span> <span class="itali">they</span> <span class="itali">had</span> <span class="itali">no</span> <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">chief</span> <span class="itali">aim</span> <span class="itali">in</span> <span class="itali">life,</span> while the five per cent constituting the successful ones not only had purposes that were <span class="itali">definite,</span> but they had, also, <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">plans</span> for the attainment of their purposes.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idv2oowxm9h">Another important fact disclosed by these analyses was that the ninety-five per cent constituting the failures were engaged in work which they did not like, while the five per cent constituting the successful ones were doing that which they liked best. It is doubtful whether a person could be a failure while engaged in work which he liked best. Another vital fact learned from the analyses was that all of the five per cent who were succeeding had formed the habit of systematic saving of money, while the ninety-five per cent who were failures saved nothing. This is worthy of serious thought.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idj8zrmy6a4">One of the chief objects of this course is to aid the student in performing his or her chosen work in such a manner that it will yield the greatest returns in both money and happiness.</p><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="idg6xjbf5jw">A Definite Chief Aim</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id74zp70dkp">The key-note of this entire lesson may be found in the word &#x201C;definite.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idkgmlv4fuc">It is most appalling to know that ninety-five per cent of the people of the world are drifting aimlessly through life, without the slightest conception of the work for which they are best fitted, and with no conception whatsoever of even the need of such a thing as a <span class="itali">definite</span> objective toward which to strive.</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="idh48tilvqy">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="idin3h8n4y5">No position in life can be secure, and no achievement can be permanent, unless built upon truth and justice.</p><p class="ENDEND" id="iddu9310nud">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idcwpdyvazp">There is a psychological as well as an economic reason for the selection of a <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">chief</span> <span class="itali">aim</span> in life. Let us devote our attention to the psychological side of the question first. It is a well established principle of psychology that a person&#x2019;s acts are always in harmony with the dominating thoughts of his or her mind.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id4brsikgqd">Any <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">chief</span> <span class="itali">aim</span> that is deliberately fixed in the mind and held there, with the determination to realize it, finally saturates the entire subconscious mind until it automatically influences the physical action of the body toward the attainment of that purpose.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ide9uiehtf5">Your <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">chief</span> <span class="itali">aim</span> in life should be selected with deliberate care, and after it has been selected it should be written out and placed where you will see it at least once a day, the psychological effect of which is to impress this purpose upon your subconscious mind so strongly that it accepts that purpose as a pattern or blueprint that will eventually dominate your activities in life and lead you, step by step, toward the attainment of the object back of that purpose.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idimgf3vj3x">The principle of psychology through which you can impress your <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">chief</span> <span class="itali">aim</span> upon your subconscious mind is called Auto-suggestion, or suggestion which you repeatedly make to yourself. It is a degree of self-hypnotism, but do not be afraid of it on that account, for it was this same principle through the aid of which Napoleon lifted himself from the lowly station of poverty-stricken Corsican to the dictatorship of France. It was through the aid of this same principle that Thomas A. Edison has risen from the lowly beginning of a news butcher to where he is accepted as the leading inventor of the world. It was through the aid of this same principle that Lincoln bridged the mighty chasm between his lowly birth, in a log cabin in the mountains of Kentucky, and the presidency of the greatest nation on earth. It was through the aid of this same principle that Theodore Roosevelt became one of the most aggressive leaders that ever reached the presidency of the United States.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idsbi3inlej">You need have no fear of the principle of Auto-suggestion as long as you are sure that the objective for which you are striving is one that will bring you happiness of an enduring nature. Be sure that your <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">purpose</span> is constructive; that its attainment will bring hardship and misery to no one; that it will bring you peace and prosperity, then apply, to the limit of your understanding, the principle of self-suggestion for the speedy attainment of this purpose.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id113ysmvbm">On the street corner, just opposite the room in which I am writing, I see a man who stands there all day long and sells peanuts. He is busy every minute. When not actually engaged in making a sale he is roasting and packing the peanuts in little bags. He is one of that great army constituting the ninety-five per cent who have no <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">purpose</span> in life. He is selling peanuts, not because he likes that work better than anything else he might do, but because he never sat down and thought out a <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">purpose</span> that would bring him greater returns for his labor. He is selling peanuts because he is a drifter on the sea of life, and one of the tragedies of his work is the fact that the same amount of effort that he puts into it, if directed along other lines, would bring him much greater returns.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idnp0264qxp">Another one of the tragedies of this man&#x2019;s work is the fact that he is unconsciously making use of the principle of self-suggestion, but he is doing it to his own disadvantage. No doubt, if a picture could be made of his thoughts, there would be nothing in that picture except a peanut roaster, some little paper bags and a crowd of people buying peanuts. This man could get out of the peanut business if he had the vision and the ambition first to imagine himself in a more profitable calling, and the perseverance to hold that picture before his mind until it influenced him to take the necessary steps to enter a more profitable calling. He puts sufficient labor into his work to bring him a substantial return if that labor were directed toward the attainment of a <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">purpose</span> that offered bigger returns.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id6ok8c8qri">One of my closest personal friends is one of the best known writers and public speakers of this country. About ten years ago he caught sight of the possibilities of this principle of self-suggestion and began, immediately, to harness it and put it to work. He worked out a plan for its application that proved to be very effective. At that time he was neither a writer nor a speaker.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idobff29cl1">Each night, just before going to sleep, he would shut his eyes and see, <span class="itali">in</span> <span class="itali">his</span> <span class="itali">imagination,</span> a long council table at which he placed (in his imagination) certain well known men whose characteristics he wished to absorb into his own personality. At the end of the table he placed Lincoln, and on either side of the table he placed Napoleon, Washington, Emerson and Elbert Hubbard. He then proceeded to talk to these imaginary figures that he had seated at his imaginary council table, something after this manner:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idv3crvdy0d">Mr. Lincoln: I desire to build in my own character those qualities of patience and fairness toward all mankind and the keen sense of humor which were your outstanding characteristics. I need these qualities and I shall not be contented until I have developed them.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idtnejhghw1">Mr. Washington: I desire to build in my own character those qualities of patriotism and self-sacrifice and leadership which were your outstanding characteristics.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idtsq8zz8l7">Mr. Emerson: I desire to build in my own character those qualities of vision and the ability to interpret the laws of Nature as written in the rocks of prison walls and growing trees and flowing brooks and growing flowers and the faces of little children, which were your outstanding characteristics.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idy0q2swwcj">Napoleon: I desire to build in my own character those qualities of self-reliance and the strategic ability to master obstacles and profit by mistakes and develop strength out of defeat, which were your outstanding characteristics.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idyh4pfdb1r">Mr. Hubbard: I desire to develop the ability to equal and even to excel the ability that you possessed with which to express yourself in clear, concise and forceful language.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id4ovt9508p">Night after night, for many months, this man saw these men seated around that imaginary council table until finally he had imprinted their outstanding characteristics upon his own subconscious mind so clearly that he began to develop a personality which was a composite of their personalities.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idzryatdx8o">The subconscious mind may be likened to a magnet, and when it has been vitalized and thoroughly saturated with any <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">purpose</span> it has a decided tendency to attract all that is necessary for the fulfillment of that purpose. Like attracts like, and you may see evidence of this law in every blade of grass and every growing tree. The acorn attracts from the soil and the air the necessary materials out of which to grow an oak tree. It never grows a tree that is part oak and part poplar. Every grain of wheat that is planted in the soil attracts the materials out of which to grow a stalk of wheat.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id4mxz61hdc">It never makes a mistake and grows both oats and wheat on the same stalk.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idcmovrw4lp">And men are subject, also, to this same Law of Attraction. Go into any cheap boarding house district in any city and there you will find people of the same general trend of mind associated together. On the other hand, go into any prosperous community and there you will find people of the same general tendencies associated together. Men who are successful always seek the company of others who are successful, while men who are on the ragged side of life always seek the company of those who are in similar circumstances. &#x201C;Misery loves company.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id106htixqa">Water seeks its level with no finer certainty than man seeks the company of those who occupy his own general status financially and mentally. A professor of Yale University and an illiterate hobo have nothing in common. They would be miserable if thrown together for any great length of time. Oil and water will mix as readily as will men who have nothing in common.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2pef2rk8p">All of which leads up to this statement:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id3yyjxjsze">That you will attract to you people who harmonize with your own philosophy of life, whether you wish it or not. This being true, can you not see the importance of vitalizing your mind with a <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">chief</span> <span class="itali">aim</span> that will attract to you people who will be of help to you and not a hindrance? Suppose your <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">chief</span> <span class="itali">aim</span> is far above your present station in life. What of it? It is your privilege&#x2014;nay, your <span class="itali">DUTY,</span> to aim high in life. You owe it to yourself and to the community in which you live to set a high standard for yourself.</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="idnul1n9ek5">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="ido1ac6w67l">Do not &#x201C;tell&#x201D; the world what you can do&#x2014;&#x201C;show&#x201D; it!</p><p class="ENDEND" id="id3td2d9gx7">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idrjy8g44hh">There is much evidence to justify the belief that nothing <span class="itali">within</span> <span class="itali">reason</span> is beyond the possibility of attainment by the man whose <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">chief</span> <span class="itali">aim</span> has been well developed. Some years ago Louis Victor Eytinge was given a life sentence in the Arizona penitentiary. At the time of his imprisonment he was an all-around &#x201C;bad man,&#x201D; according to his own admissions. In addition to this it was believed that he would die of tuberculosis within a year.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idfsz4ulz9e">Eytinge had reason to feel discouraged, if anyone ever had.

These principles are as follows:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idd72nu3tw3"><span class="itali">First:</span> Every voluntary movement of the human body is caused, controlled and directed by <span class="itali">thought,</span> through the operation of the mind.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idf69c5huok"><span class="itali">Second:</span> The presence of any thought or idea in your consciousness tends to produce an associated feeling and to urge you to transform that feeling into appropriate muscular action that is in perfect harmony with the nature of the thought.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddtocqie1f">For example, if you think of winking your eyelid and there are no counter influences or thoughts in your mind at the time to arrest action, the motor nerve will carry your thought from the seat of government, in your brain, and appropriate or corresponding muscular action takes place immediately.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idmjpb7lo36">Stating this principle from another angle: You choose, for example, a <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">purpose</span> as your lifework and make up your mind that you will carry out that purpose. <span class="itali">From</span> <span class="itali">the</span> <span class="itali">very</span> <span class="itali">moment</span> <span class="itali">that</span> <span class="itali">you</span> <span class="itali">make</span> <span class="itali">this</span> <span class="itali">choice,</span> <span class="itali">this</span> <span class="itali">purpose</span> <span class="itali">becomes</span> <span class="itali">the</span> <span class="itali">dominating</span> <span class="itali">thought</span> <span class="itali">in</span> <span class="itali">your</span> <span class="itali">consciousness,</span> <span class="itali">and</span> <span class="itali">you</span> <span class="itali">are</span> <span class="itali">constantly</span> <span class="itali">on</span> <span class="itali">the</span> <span class="itali">alert</span> <span class="itali">for</span> <span class="itali">facts,</span> <span class="itali">information</span> <span class="itali">and</span> <span class="itali">knowledge</span> <span class="itali">with</span> <span class="itali">which</span> <span class="itali">to</span> <span class="itali">achieve</span> <span class="itali">that</span> <span class="itali">purpose.</span> From the time that you plant a <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">purpose</span> in your mind, your mind begins, both consciously and unconsciously, to gather and store away the material with which you are to accomplish that purpose.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddbqh2hhfi"><span class="itali">Desire</span> is the factor which determines what your <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">purpose</span> in life shall be. No one can select your dominating <span class="itali">desire</span> for you, but once you select it yourself it becomes your <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">chief</span> <span class="itali">aim</span> and occupies the spotlight of your mind until it is satisfied by transformation into reality, unless you permit it to be pushed aside by conflicting desires.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idn8mia6p6o">To emphasize the principle that I am here trying to make clear, I believe it not unreasonable to suggest that to be sure of successful achievement, one&#x2019;s <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">chief</span> <span class="itali">aim</span> in life should be backed up with a <span class="itali">burning</span> <span class="itali">desire</span> for its achievement. I have noticed that boys and girls who enter college and pay their way through by working seem to get more out of their schooling than do those whose expenses are paid for them. The secret of this may be found in the fact that those who are willing to work their way through are blessed with a <span class="itali">burning</span> <span class="itali">desire</span> for education, and such a desire, if the object of the desire is within reason, is practically sure of realization.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idy189oj4th">Science has established, beyond the slightest room for doubt, that through the principle of Auto-suggestion any deeply rooted <span class="itali">desire</span> saturates the entire body and mind with the nature of the desire and literally transforms the mind into a powerful magnet that will attract the object of the desire, if it be within reason. For the enlightenment of those who might not properly interpret the meaning of this statement I will endeavor to state this principle in another way. For example, merely desiring an automobile will not cause that automobile to come rolling in, but, if there is a <span class="itali">burning</span> <span class="itali">desire</span> for an automobile, that desire will lead to the appropriate action through which an automobile may be paid for.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ide5214r724">Merely desiring freedom would never release a man who was confined in prison if it were not sufficiently strong to cause him to do something to entitle himself to freedom.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id4hg2au8ki">These are the steps leading from <span class="itali">desire</span> to fulfillment: First the <span class="itali">burning</span> <span class="itali">desire,</span> then the crystallization of that desire into a <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">purpose,</span> then sufficient appropriate <span class="itali">action</span> to achieve that purpose. <span class="itali">Remember</span> <span class="itali">that</span> <span class="itali">these</span> <span class="itali">three</span> <span class="itali">steps</span> <span class="itali">are</span> <span class="itali">always</span> <span class="itali">necessary</span> <span class="itali">to</span> <span class="itali">insure</span> <span class="itali">success.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id0bv2vy23y">I once knew a very poor girl who had a <span class="itali">burning</span> <span class="itali">desire</span> for a wealthy husband, and she finally got him, but not without having transformed that desire into the development of a very attractive personality which, in turn, attracted the desired husband.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id872d0z6qb">I once had a <span class="itali">burning</span> <span class="itali">desire</span> to be able to analyze character accurately and that desire was so persistent and so deeply seated that it practically drove me into ten years of research and study of men and women.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idarkdp3knd">George S.

He backed that purpose with a <span class="itali">burning</span> <span class="itali">desire</span> for its realization and if you carry a fountain pen the chances are that you have evidence in your own possession that it has brought him abundant success.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idfsifqdecm">You are a contractor and builder, and, like men who build houses out of mere wood and brick and steel, you must draw up a set of plans after which to shape your <span class="itali">success</span> <span class="itali">building.</span> You are living in a wonderful age, when the materials that go into <span class="itali">success</span> are plentiful and cheap.

If you would become a preacher you have at hand the entire history of what has been learned by men who have preceded you in this field. If you would become a mechanic you have at hand the entire history of the inventions of machines and the discovery and usages of metals and things metallic in nature. If you would become a lawyer you have at your disposal the entire history of law procedure.

Follow those laid down in the Course, as they are the result of years of thought and experimentation. If you wish to experiment wait until you master this course in the manner suggested by its author. You will then be in position to experiment more safely.

Your next step is to write out a clear, concise statement of this aim. This should be followed by a statement, in writing, of the plan or plans through which you intend to attain the object of your aim.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idds9etjmbn">Your next and final step will be the forming of an alliance with some person or persons who will co-operate with you in carrying out these plans and transforming your <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">chief</span> <span class="itali">aim</span> into reality.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id0aare2na8">The purpose of this friendly alliance is to employ the law of the &#x201C;Master Mind&#x201D; in support of your plans. The alliance should be made between yourself and those who have your highest and best interests at heart. If you are a married man your wife should be one of the members of this alliance, providing there exists between you a normal state of confidence and sympathy. Other members of this alliance may be your mother, father, brothers or sisters, or some close friend or friends.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ideglofdayz">If you are a single person your sweetheart, if you have one, should become a member of your alliance. This is no joke&#x2014;you are now studying one of the most powerful laws of the human mind, and you will serve your own best interests by seriously and earnestly following the rules laid down in this lesson, even though you may not be sure where they will lead you.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idjn2xzw8ea">Those who join with you in the formation of a friendly alliance for the purpose of aiding you in the creation of a &#x201C;Master Mind&#x201D; should sign, with you, your statement of the object of your <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">chief</span> <span class="itali">aim.</span> Every member of your alliance must be fully acquainted with the nature of your object in forming the alliance. Moreover, every member must be in hearty accord with this object, and in full sympathy with you. Each member of your alliance must be supplied with a written copy of your statement of your <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">chief</span> <span class="itali">aim.</span> With this exception, however, <span class="itali">you</span> <span class="itali">are</span> <span class="itali">explicitly</span> <span class="itali">instructed</span> <span class="itali">to</span> <span class="itali">keep</span> <span class="itali">the</span> <span class="itali">object</span> <span class="itali">of</span> <span class="itali">your</span> <span class="itali">chief</span> <span class="itali">aim</span> <span class="itali">to</span> <span class="itali">yourself.</span> The world is full of &#x201C;Doubting Thomases&#x201D; and it will do your cause no good to have these rattle-brained people scoffing at you and your ambitions.

If you believe there is a God who can and will aid those who are earnestly striving to be of constructive service in the world, surely you feel that you have a right to petition Him for aid in the attainment of what should be the most important thing in life to you.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idhv5545n8z">If those who have been invited to join your friendly alliance believe in prayer, ask them, also, to include the object of this alliance as a part of their daily prayer.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idlh922ks3b">Comes, now, one of the most essential rules which you <span class="itali">must</span> <span class="itali">follow.</span> Arrange with one or all of the members of your friendly alliance to state to you, in the most positive and definite terms at their command, that THEY KNOW YOU CAN AND WILL REALIZE THE OBJECT OF YOUR DEFINITE CHIEF AIM. This affirmation or statement should be made to you at least once a day; more often if possible.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idj5fn14awk">These steps must be followed persistently, with full faith that they will lead you where you wish to go! It will not suffice to carry out these plans for a few days or a few weeks and then discontinue them. YOU MUST FOLLOW THE DESCRIBED PROCEDURE UNTIL YOU ATTAIN THE OBJECT OF YOUR DEFINITE CHIEF AIM, REGARDLESS OF THE TIME REQUIRED.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idvftt7nmqu">From time to time it may become necessary to change the plans you have adopted for the achievement of the object of your <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">chief</span> <span class="itali">aim.</span> Make these changes without hesitation. No human being has sufficient foresight to build plans which need no alteration or change.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idotziue8ra">If any member of your friendly alliance loses faith in the law known as the &#x201C;Master Mind,&#x201D; immediately remove that member and replace him or her with some other person.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iduc4beednd">Andrew Carnegie stated to the author of this course that he had found it necessary to replace some of the members of his &#x201C;Master Mind.&#x201D; In fact he stated that practically every member of whom his alliance was originally composed had, in time, been removed and replaced with some other person who could adapt himself more loyally and enthusiastically to the spirit and object of the alliance.</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="id7gjhrsrjg">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="iddqq314upq">&#x201C;Yes, he succeeded&#x2014;but&#x2014;he almost failed!&#x201D; So did Robert Fulton and Abraham Lincoln and nearly all the others whom we call successful.

In such cases the same rules of procedure which have been here described should be followed. The object of your <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">chief</span> <span class="itali">aim</span> may be one that will benefit you individually, or it may be one that will benefit the business or profession with which you are connected.

There is a difference, however, between merely &#x201C;wishing&#x201D; for something and ACTUALLY BELIEVING you will get it. Lack of understanding of this difference has meant failure to millions of people. The &#x201C;doers&#x201D; are the &#x201C;believers&#x201D; in all walks of life. Those who BELIEVE they can achieve the object of their <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">chief</span> <span class="itali">aim</span> do not recognize the word impossible. Neither do they acknowledge temporary defeat. They KNOW they are going to succeed, and if one plan fails they quickly replace it with another plan.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id0vdiqmdtb">Every noteworthy achievement met with some sort of temporary setback before success came.

One is known as physical heredity and the other is called social heredity.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idzyxsnek7z">Through the law of physical heredity man has slowly evolved from the amoeba (a single-cell animal form), through stages of development corresponding to all the known animal forms now on this earth, including those which are known to have existed but which are now extinct.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id96rpga5wk">Every generation through which man has passed has added to his nature something of the traits, habits and physical appearance of that generation. Man&#x2019;s physical inheritance, therefore, is a heterogeneous collection of many habits and physical forms.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idhclpg6u0f">There seems little, if any, doubt that while the six basic fears of man could not have been inherited through physical heredity (these six basic fears being mental states of mind and therefore not capable of transmission through physical heredity), it is obvious that through physical heredity a most favorable lodging place for these six fears has been provided.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id36t8nsal4">For example, it is a well known fact that the whole process of physical evolution is based upon death, destruction, pain and cruelty; that the elements of the soil of the earth find transportation, in their upward climb through evolution, based upon the death of one form of life in order that another and higher form may subsist. All vegetation lives by &#x201C;eating&#x201D; the elements of the soil and the elements of the air. All forms of animal life live by &#x201C;eating&#x201D; some other and weaker form, or some form of vegetation.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idv7vfghuf9">The cells of all vegetation have a very high order of intelligence. The cells of all animal life likewise have a very high order of intelligence.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idde7raymeh">Undoubtedly the animal cells of a fish have learned, out of bitter experience, that the group of animal cells known as a fish hawk are to be greatly feared.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9oiyi5ev6">By reason of the fact that many animal forms (including that of most men) live by eating the smaller and weaker animals, the &#x201C;cell intelligence&#x201D; of these animals which enter into and become a part of man brings with it the FEAR growing out of their experience in having been eaten alive.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idhqmav1jjr">This theory may seem to be far-fetched, and in fact it may not be true, but it is at least a logical theory if it is nothing more. The author makes no particular point of this theory, nor does he insist that it accounts for any of the six basic fears. There is another, and a much better explanation of the source of these fears, which we will proceed to examine, beginning with a description of social heredity.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idu2qnr0dk2">By far the most important part of man&#x2019;s make-up comes to him through the law of social heredity, this term having reference to the methods by which one generation imposes upon the minds of the generation under its immediate control the superstitions, beliefs, legends and ideas which it, in turn, inherited from the generation preceding.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idyoql8kfhs">The term &#x201C;social heredity&#x201D; should be understood to mean any and all sources through which a person acquires knowledge, such as schooling of religious and all other natures; reading, word of mouth conversation, story telling and all manner of thought inspiration coming from what is generally accepted as one&#x2019;s &#x201C;personal experiences.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1reaa4bc0">Through the operation of the law of social heredity anyone having control of the mind of a child may, through intense teaching, plant in that child&#x2019;s mind any idea, whether false or true, in such a manner that the child accepts it as true and it becomes as much a part of the child&#x2019;s personality as any cell or organ of its physical body (and just as hard to change in its nature).</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="idcepz4yhbn">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="id14aafoqom">Remember that when you make an appointment with another person you assume the responsibility of punctuality, and that you have not the right to be a single minute late.</p><p class="ENDEND" id="idgtfkmt32a">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idlyidcaqy6">It is through the law of social heredity that the religionist plants in the child mind dogmas and creeds and religious ceremonies too numerous to describe, holding those ideas before that mind until the mind accepts them and forever seals them as a part of its irrevocable belief.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ida2j3hrgjh">The mind of a child which has not come into the age of general understanding, during an average period covering, let us say, the first two years of its life, is plastic, open, clean and free. Any idea planted in such a mind by one in whom the child has confidence takes root and grows, so to speak, in such a manner that it never can be eradicated or wiped out, no matter how opposed to logic or reason that idea may be.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idmrllmz9se">Many religionists claim that they can so deeply implant the tenets of their religion in the mind of a child that there never can be room in that mind for any other religion, either in whole or in part. The claims are not greatly overdrawn.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id0xltue4ih">With this explanation of the manner in which the law of social heredity operates the student will be ready to examine the sources from which man inherits the six basic fears. Moreover, any student (except those who have not yet grown big enough to examine truth that steps upon the &#x201C;pet corns&#x201D; of their own superstitions) may check the soundness of the principle of social heredity as it is here applied to the six basic fears, without going outside of his or her own personal experiences.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id8zefqw2k5">Fortunately, practically the entire mass of evidence submitted in this lesson is of such a nature that all who sincerely seek the truth may ascertain, for themselves, whether the evidence is sound or not.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idvrj3p5h96">For the moment at least, lay aside your prejudices and preconceived ideas (you may always go back and pick them up again, you know) while we study the origin and nature of man&#x2019;s Six Worst Enemies, the six basic fears, beginning with:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idg6ekt03ne"><span class="cs-headcshd">The Fear of Poverty: </span>It requires courage to tell the truth about the origin of this fear, and still greater courage, perhaps, to accept the truth after it has been told. The fear of poverty grew out of man&#x2019;s inherited tendency to prey upon his fellow man economically. Nearly all forms of lower animals have instinct but appear not to have the power to reason and think; therefore, they prey upon one another physically. Man, with his superior sense of intuition, thought and reason, does not eat his fellow men bodily; he gets more satisfaction out of eating them FINANCIALLY!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id7414izwcl">Of all the ages of the world of which we know anything, the age in which we live seems to be the age of money worship. A man is considered less than the dust of the earth unless he can display a fat bank account. Nothing brings man so much suffering and humiliation as does POVERTY. No wonder man FEARS poverty. Through a long line of inherited experiences with the man-animal man has learned, for certain, that this animal cannot always be trusted where matters of money and other evidences of earthly possessions are concerned.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ididmua2dxg">Many marriages have their beginning (and oftentimes their ending) solely on the basis of the wealth possessed by one or both of the contracting parties. It is no wonder that the divorce courts are busy!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idg8f316xcq">&#x201C;Society&#x201D; could quite properly be spelled &#x201C;$ociety,&#x201D; because it is inseparably associated with the dollar mark. So eager is man to possess wealth that he will acquire it in whatever manner he can; through legal methods, if possible, through other methods if necessary.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ideqqwoooag">The fear of poverty is a terrible thing!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idm7qnwlzyo">A man may commit murder, engage in robbery, rape and all other manner of violation of the rights of others and still regain a high station in the minds of his fellow men, PROVIDING always that he does not lose his wealth. Poverty, therefore, is a crime&#x2014;an unforgivable sin, as it were.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idfst921kpo">No wonder man fears it!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2a8t9pt0q">Every statute book in the world bears evidence that the fear of poverty is one of the six basic fears of mankind, for in every such book of laws may be found various and sundry laws intended to protect the weak from the strong. To spend time trying to prove either that the fear of poverty is one of man&#x2019;s inherited fears, or that this fear has its origin in man&#x2019;s nature to cheat his fellow man, would be similar to trying to prove that three times two are six. Obviously no man would ever fear poverty if he had any grounds for trusting his fellow men, for there is food and shelter and raiment and luxury of every nature sufficient for the needs of every person on earth, and all these blessings would be enjoyed by every person except for the swinish habit that man has of trying to push all the other &#x201C;swine&#x201D; out of the trough, even after he has all and more than he needs.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2h2gbqvrh">The second of the six basic fears with which man is bound is:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idvnux6q4qq"><span class="cs-headcshd">The Fear of Old Age: </span>In the main this fear grows out of two sources. First, the thought that Old Age may bring with it POVERTY. Secondly, and by far the most common source of origin, from false and cruel sectarian teachings which have been so well mixed with &#x201C;fire and brimstone&#x201D; and with &#x201C;purgatories&#x201D; and other bogies that human beings have learned to fear Old Age because it meant the approach of another, and possibly a much more HORRIBLE, world than this one which is known to be bad enough.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id0xct0hmv5">In the basic fear of Old Age man has two very sound reasons for his apprehension: the one growing out of distrust of his fellow men who may seize whatever worldly goods he may possess, and the other arising from the terrible pictures of the world to come which were deeply planted in his mind, through the law of social heredity, long before he came into possession of that mind.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idtobhx6p8s">Is it any wonder that man fears the approach of Old Age?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idpuag8443q">The third of the six basic fears is:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idqklgm5s8e"><span class="cs-headcshd">The Fear of Criticism: </span>Just how man acquired this basic fear it would be hard, if not impossible, definitely to determine, but one thing is certain, he has it in well developed form.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idwzslk20kl">Some believe that this fear made its appearance in the mind of man about the time that politics came into existence. Others believe its source can be traced no further than the first meeting of an organization of females known as a &#x201C;Woman&#x2019;s Club.&#x201D; Still another school of humorists charges the origin to the contents of the Holy Bible, whose pages abound with some very vitriolic and violent forms of criticism. If the latter claim is correct, and those who believe literally all they find in the Bible are not mistaken, then God is responsible for man&#x2019;s inherent fear of Criticism, because God caused the Bible to be written.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idnh9hu8tez">This author, being neither a humorist nor a &#x201C;prophet,&#x201D; but just an ordinary workaday type of person, is inclined to attribute the basic fear of Criticism to that part of man&#x2019;s inherited nature which prompts him not only to take away his fellow man&#x2019;s goods and wares, but to justify his action by CRITICISM of his fellow man&#x2019;s character.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idpk67fooff">The fear of Criticism takes on many different forms, the majority of which are petty and trivial in nature, even to the extent of being childish in the extreme.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9jl0dzuhq">Bald-headed men, for example, are bald for no other reason than their fear of Criticism. Heads become bald because of the protection of hats with tight fitting bands which cut off the circulation at the roots of the hair. Men wear hats, not because they actually need them for the sake of comfort, but mainly because &#x201C;everybody&#x2019;s doing it,&#x201D; and the individual falls in line and does it also, lest some other individual CRITICIZE him.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idugexwfnur">Women seldom have bald heads, or even thin hair, because they wear hats that are loose, the only purpose of which is to make an appearance.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id4n1sqk9t5">But it must not be imagined that women are free from the fear of Criticism associated with hats. If any woman claims to be superior to man with reference to this fear, ask her to walk down the street wearing a hat that is one or two seasons out of style!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idtiof1e9j0">The makers of all manner of clothing have not been slow to capitalize this basic fear of Criticism with which all mankind is cursed. Every season, it will be observed, the &#x201C;styles&#x201D; in many articles of wearing apparel change. Who establishes the &#x201C;styles&#x201D;? Certainly not the purchaser of clothes, but the manufacturer of clothes. Why does he change the styles so often? Obviously this change is made so that the manufacturer can sell more clothes.</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="id8gmnlit4l">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="idyinrmehjr">In every soul there has been deposited the seed of a great future, but that seed will never germinate, much less grow to maturity, except through the rendering of useful service.</p><p class="ENDEND" id="idocwdt2b9g">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idf054atp7p">For the same reason the manufacturers of automobiles (with a few rare and very sensible exceptions) change styles every season.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id36ngivtz8">The manufacturer of clothing knows how the man-animal fears to wear a garment which is one season out of step with &#x201C;that which they are all wearing now.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idkjncjsi4k">Is this not true? Does not your own experience back it up?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idd20f7z9u7">We have been describing the manner in which people behave under the influence of the fear of Criticism as applied to the small and petty things of life. Let us now examine human behavior under this fear when it affects people in connection with the more important matters connected with human intercourse. Take, for example, practically any person who has reached the age of &#x201C;mental maturity&#x201D; (from thirty-five to forty-five years of age, as a general average), and if you could read his or her mind you would find in that mind a very decided disbelief of and rebellion against most of the fables taught by the majority of the religionists.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idm6rjwxbkb">Powerful and mighty is the fear of CRITICISM!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id3peufyfnp">The time was, and not so very long ago at that, when the word &#x201C;infidel&#x201D; meant ruin to whomsoever it was applied. It is seen, therefore, that man&#x2019;s fear of CRITICISM is not without ample cause for its existence.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddb5lruyim">The fourth basic fear is that of:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9sck8jki1"><span class="cs-headcshd">The Fear of Loss of Love of Someone: </span>The source from which this fear originated needs but little description, for it is obvious that it grew out of man&#x2019;s nature to steal his fellow man&#x2019;s mate; or at least to take liberties with her, unknown to her rightful &#x201C;lord&#x201D; and master. By nature all men are polygamous, the statement of a truth which will, of course, bring denials from those who are either too old to function in a normal way sexually, or have, from some other cause, lost the contents of certain glands which are responsible for man&#x2019;s tendency toward the plurality of the opposite sex.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idizp4mdn86">There can be but little doubt that jealousy and all other similar forms of more or less mild dementia praecox (insanity) grew out of man&#x2019;s inherited fear of the Loss of Love of Someone.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idwkz5zp8ad">Of all the &#x201C;sane fools&#x201D; studied by this author, that represented by a man who has become jealous of some woman, or that of a woman who has become jealous of some man, is the oddest and strangest. The author, fortunately, never had but one case of personal experience with this form of insanity, but from that experience he learned enough to justify him in stating that the fear of the Loss of Love of Someone is one of the most painful, if not in fact the most painful, of all the six basic fears. And it seems reasonable to add that this fear plays more havoc with the human mind than do any of the other six basic fears, often leading to the more violent forms of permanent insanity.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idhjmwicv9g">The fifth basic fear is that of:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ida9cf5aopo"><span class="cs-headcshd">The Fear of Ill Health: </span>This fear has its origin, to considerable extent also, in the same sources from which the fears of Poverty and Old Age are derived.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddnzc9gins">The fear of Ill Health must needs be closely associated with both Poverty and Old Age, because it also leads toward the border line of &#x201C;terrible worlds&#x201D; of which man knows not, but of which he has heard some discomforting stories.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id30w462xhl">The author strongly suspects that those engaged in the business of selling good health methods have had considerable to do with keeping the fear of Ill Health alive in the human mind.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id707cqvchd">For longer than the record of the human race can be relied upon, the world has known of various and sundry forms of therapy and health purveyors. If a man gains his living from keeping people in good health it seems but natural that he would use every means at his command for persuading people that they needed his services. Thus, in time, it might be that people would inherit a fear of Ill Health.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id96y4djo09">The sixth and last of the Six Basic Fears is that of:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id6j02zk5r2"><span class="cs-headcshd">The Fear of Death! </span>To many this is the worst of all the six basic fears, and the reason why it is so regarded becomes obvious to even the casual student of psychology.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id4hqgi3r7d">The terrible pangs of fear associated with DEATH may be charged directly to religious fanaticism, the source which is more responsible for it than are all other sources combined.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id6pd9gwl63">So-called &#x201C;heathen&#x201D; are not as much afraid of DEATH as are the &#x201C;civilized,&#x201D; especially that portion of the civilized population which has come under the influence of theology.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idfmbpubgvl">For hundreds of millions of years man has been asking the still unanswered (and, it may be, the unanswerable) questions, &#x201C;WHENCE?&#x201D; and &#x201C;WHITHER?&#x201D; &#x201C;Where did I come from and where am I going after death?&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id28evzzim6">The more cunning and crafty, as well as the honest but credulous, of the race have not been slow to offer the answer to these questions. In fact the answering of these questions has become one of the so-called &#x201C;learned&#x201D; professions, despite the fact that but little learning is required to enter this profession.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id7vwt2ucn2">Witness, now, the major source of origin of the fear of DEATH!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idbvvybhzmb">&#x201C;Come into my tent, embrace my faith, accept my dogmas (and pay my salary) and I will give you a ticket that will admit you straightway into heaven when you die,&#x201D; says the leader of one form of sectarianism. &#x201C;Remain out of my tent,&#x201D; says this same leader, &#x201C;and you will go direct to hell, where you will burn throughout eternity.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id5hpve8u1x">While, in fact, the self-appointed leader may not be able to provide safe-conduct into heaven nor, by lack of such provision, allow the unfortunate seeker after truth to descend into hell, the possibility of the latter seems so terrible that it lays hold of the mind and creates that fear of fears, the fear of DEATH!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idco1g40oij">In truth no man knows, and no man has ever known, what heaven or hell is like, or if such places exist, and this very lack of definite knowledge opens the door of the human mind to the charlatan to enter and control that mind with his stock of legerdemain and various brands of trickery, deceit and fraud.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idubn1vs6m7">The truth is this&#x2014;nothing less and nothing more&#x2014;That NO MAN KNOWS NOR HAS ANY MAN EVER KNOWN WHERE WE COME FROM AT BIRTH OR WHERE WE GO AT DEATH. Any person claiming otherwise is either deceiving himself or he is a conscious impostor who makes it a business to live without rendering service of value, through play upon the credulity of humanity.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idjb4int3c2">Be it said, in their behalf, however, the majority of those engaged in &#x201C;selling tickets into heaven&#x201D; actually believe not only that they know where heaven exists, but that their creeds and formulas will give safe passage to all who embrace them.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idryp8oxlps">This belief may be summed up in one word&#x2014;CREDULITY!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idpqub317cj">Religious leaders, generally, make the broad, sweeping claim that the present civilization owes its existence to the work done by the churches. This author, as far as he is personally concerned, is willing to grant their claims to be correct, if, at the same time he be permitted to add that even if this claim be true the theologians haven&#x2019;t a great deal of which to brag.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idlrvfglzxs">But, it is not&#x2014;cannot be&#x2014;true that civilization has grown out of the efforts of the organized churches and creeds, if by the term &#x201C;civilization&#x201D; is meant the uncovering of the natural laws and the many inventions to which the world is the present heir.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idzchdcbk0n">If the theologians wish to claim that part of civilization which has to do with man&#x2019;s conduct toward his fellow man they are perfectly welcome to it, as far as this author is concerned; but, on the other hand, if they presume to gobble up the credit for all the scientific discovery of mankind the author begs leave to offer vigorous protest.</p><p class="Blank-Space-BreakBsbrk" id="idvtq4fsj99">[blank]</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idlqmiwbq4o">It is hardly sufficient to state that social heredity is the method through which man gathers all knowledge that reaches him through the five senses. It is more to the point to state HOW social heredity works, in as many different applications as will give the student a comprehensive understanding of that law.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id8pfzvgzif">Let us begin with some of the lower forms of animal life and examine the manner in which they are affected by the law of social heredity.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idegq17ijvy">Shortly after this author began to examine the major sources from which men gather the knowledge which makes them what they are, some thirty-odd years ago, he discovered the nest of a ruffed grouse. The nest was so located that the mother bird could be seen from a considerable distance when she was on the nest. With the aid of a pair of field glasses the bird was closely watched until the young birds were hatched out. It happened that the regular daily observation was made but a few hours after the young birds came out of the shell. Desiring to know what would happen, the author approached the nest. The mother bird remained nearby until the intruder was within ten or twelve feet of her, then she disarranged her feathers, stretched one wing over her leg and went hobbling away, making a pretense of being crippled. Being some-what familiar with the tricks of mother birds, the author did not follow, but, instead, went to the nest to take a look at the little ones. Without the slightest signs of fear they turned their eyes toward him, moving their heads first one way and then another. He reached down and picked one of them up. With no signs of fear it stood in the palm of his hand. He laid the bird back in the nest and went away to a safe distance to give the mother bird a chance to return.</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="id5m68q331i">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="id47v2nk87o">You are fortunate if you have learned the difference between temporary defeat and failure; more fortunate still, if you have learned the truth that the very seed of success is dormant in every defeat that you experience.</p><p class="ENDEND" id="id9lm4w302k">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idaz6hihhjn">The wait was short. Very soon she began cautiously to edge her way back toward the nest until she was within a few feet of it, when she spread her wings and ran as fast as she could, uttering, meanwhile, a series of sounds similar to those of a hen when she has found some morsel of food and wishes to call her brood to partake of it.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idgz3jxyl1t">She gathered the little birds around and continued to quiver in a highly excited manner, shaking her wings and ruffling her feathers. One could almost hear her words as she gave the little birds their first lesson in self-defense, through the law of SOCIAL HEREDITY:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id8x118p8va">&#x201C;You silly little creatures! Do you not know that men are your enemies? Shame on you for allowing that man to pick you up in his hands. It&#x2019;s a wonder he didn&#x2019;t carry you off and eat you alive! The next time you see a man approaching make yourselves scarce. Lie down on the ground, run under leaves, go anywhere to get out of sight, and remain out of sight until the enemy is well on his way.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id7ifb07f84">The little birds stood around and listened to the lecture with intense interest. After the mother bird had quieted down the author again started to approach the nest. When within twenty feet or so of the guarded household the mother bird again started to lead him in the other direction by crumpling up her wing and hobbling along as if she were crippled. He looked at the nest, but the glance was in vain. The little birds were nowhere to be found! They had learned rapidly to avoid their natural enemy, thanks to their natural instinct.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idqfhizhv2n">Again the author retreated, awaited until the mother bird had reassembled her household, then came out to visit them, but with similar results. When he approached the spot where he last saw the mother bird not the slightest signs of the little fellows were to be found.</p><p class="Blank-Space-BreakBsbrk" id="idgdgokkj2h">[blank]</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idyttj7bezh">When a small boy the author captured a young crow and made a pet of it. The bird became quite well satisfied with its domestic surroundings and learned to perform many tricks requiring considerable intelligence. After the bird was big enough to fly it was permitted to go wherever it pleased. Sometimes it would be gone for many hours, but it always returned home before dark.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idg4jvlga6j">One day some wild crows became involved in a fight with an owl in a field near the house where the pet crow lived. As soon as the pet heard the &#x201C;caw, caw, caw&#x201D; of its wild relatives it flew up on top of the house, and with signs of great agitation, walked from one end of the house to the other. Finally it took wing and flew in the direction of the &#x201C;battle.&#x201D; The author followed to see what would happen. In a few minutes he came up with the pet. It was sitting on the lower branches of a tree and two wild crows were sitting on a limb just above, chattering and walking back and forth, acting very much in the same fashion that angry parents behave toward their off-spring when chastising them.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9cx6u1bdl">As the author approached, the two wild crows flew away, one of them circling around the tree a few times, meanwhile letting out a terrible flow of most abusive language, which, no doubt, was directed at its foolish relative who hadn&#x2019;t enough sense to fly while the flying was good.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idc2z4b9344">The pet was called, but it paid no attention. That evening it returned home, but would not come near the house. It sat on a high limb of an apple tree and talked in crow language for about ten minutes, saying, no doubt, that it had decided to go back to the wild life of its fellows, then flew away and did not return until two days later, when it came back and did some more talking in crow language, keeping at a safe distance meanwhile. It then went away and never returned.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idv6l1rbwub">Social heredity had robbed the author of a fine pet!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idvewcq9qz7">The only consolation he got from the loss of his crow was the thought that it had shown fine sportsmanship by coming back and giving notice of its intention to depart.

No reason need be stated as to why Mr. Skunk enjoys immunity. A fox may tackle a skunk once, but never twice! For this reason a skunk hide, when nailed to a chicken roost, will keep all but the very young and inexperienced foxes at a safe distance.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id6dbjnokak">The odor of a skunk, once experienced, is never to be forgotten. No other smell even remotely resembles it. It is nowhere recorded that any mother fox ever taught her young how to detect and keep away from the familiar smell of a skunk, but all who are informed on &#x201C;fox lore&#x201D; know that foxes and skunks never seek lodgment in the same cave.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idwj14zbr3e">But one lesson is sufficient to teach the fox all it cares to know about skunks.

That is, Mr. Frog may be caught in this manner, provided he is hooked the first time he snaps at the bait, but if he is poorly hooked and makes a get-away, or if he feels the point of the hook when he bites at the bait but is not caught, he will never make the same mistake again. The author spent many hours in stealthy attempt to hook a particularly desirable specimen which had snapped and missed, before learning that but one lesson in social heredity is enough to teach even a humble &#x201C;croaker&#x201D; that bits of red flannel are things to be let alone.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idkztx1oh4m">The author once owned a very fine male Airedale dog which caused no end of annoyance by his habit of coming home with a young chicken in his mouth.

The hen was placed in the barn and the dog was turned in with her. As soon as everyone was out of sight the dog slowly edged up toward the hen, sniffed the air in her direction a time or two (to make sure she was the kind of meat for which he was looking), then made a dive toward her. Meanwhile Mrs. Hen had been doing some &#x201C;surveying&#x201D; on her own account, for she met Mr. Dog more than halfway; moreover, she met him with such a surprise of wings and claws as he had never before experienced. The first round was clearly the hen&#x2019;s. But a nice fat bird, reckoned the dog, was not to slip between his paws so easily; therefore he backed away a short distance, then charged again. This time Mrs. Hen lit upon his back, drove her claws into his skin and made effective use of her sharp bill! Mr. Dog retreated to his corner, looking for all the world as if he were listening for someone to ring the bell and call the fight off until he got his bearings. But Mrs. Hen craved no time for deliberation; she had her adversary on the run and showed that she knew the value of the offensive by keeping him on the run.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9lddyez5h">One could almost understand her words as she flogged the poor Airedale from one corner to another, keeping up a series of rapid-fire sounds which for all the world resembled the remonstrations of an angry mother who had been called upon to defend her off-spring from an attack by older boys.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idybgub11q8">The Airedale was a poor soldier! After running around the barn from corner to corner for about two minutes he spread himself on the ground as flat as he could and did his best to protect his eyes with his paws. Mrs. Hen seemed to be making a special attempt to peck out his eyes.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idsin8iccyf">The owner of the hen then stepped in and retrieved her&#x2014;or, more accurately stating it, he retrieved the dog&#x2014;which in no way appeared to meet with the dog&#x2019;s disapproval.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idwoa27rjby">The next day a chicken was placed in the cellar where the dog slept. As soon as he saw the bird he tucked his tail between his legs and ran for a corner! He never again attempted to catch a chicken. One lesson in social heredity, via the sense of &#x201C;touch,&#x201D; was sufficient to teach him that while chicken-chasing may offer some enjoyment, it is also fraught with much hazard.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ide7u8860ug">All these illustrations, with the exception of the first, describe the process of gathering knowledge through direct experience.

Forthwith he decides (through self-suggestion) all men are untrustworthy and all neighbors unappreciative.

If people speak to him harshly he speaks back in tones of softness. Through the operation of this same eternal Law of Attraction he draws to himself the attention of people whose attitude toward life and whose dominating thoughts harmonize with his own.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idnd637e6js">Tracing the principle a step further:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idvjt9oji9t">Here is a man who has been well schooled and has the ability to render the world some needed service.

He remains in the back row because he <span class="itali">fears</span> &#x201C;what <span class="itali">they</span> will say.&#x201D; Public opinion, or that which he believes to be public opinion, has him pushed to the rear and the world hears but little of him. His schooling counts for naught because he is <span class="itali">afraid</span> to let the world know that he has had it. He is constantly <span class="itali">suggesting</span> to <span class="itali">himself</span> (thus using the great force of Auto-suggestion to his own detriment) that he should remain in the background lest he be criticized, as if criticism would do him any damage or defeat his purpose.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idoqekfwqwh">Here is another man who was born of poor parents.

Some years ago a baby boy was born to Mrs. E. B. McLean, in the city of Washington. His inheritance was said to be around a hundred million dollars. When this baby was taken for an airing in its carriage it was surrounded by nurses and assistant nurses and detectives and other servants whose duty was to see that no harm befell it. As the years passed by this same vigilance was kept up. This child did not have to dress himself; he had servants who did that. Servants watched over him while he slept and while he was at play. He was not permitted to do anything that a servant could do for him. He had grown to the age of ten years. One day he was playing in the yard and noticed that the back gate had been left open. In all of his life he had never been outside of that gate alone, and naturally that was just the thing that he wished to do. During a moment when the servants were not looking he dashed out at the gate, and was run down and killed by an automobile before he reached the middle of the street.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idl1xu1olsv">He had used his servants&#x2019; eyes until his own no longer served him as they might have done had he learned to rely upon them.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2c5lht3qa">Twenty years ago the man whom I served as secretary sent his two sons away to school. One of them went to the University of Virginia and the other to a college in New York. Each month it was a part of my task to make out a check for $100.00 for each of these boys. This was their &#x201C;pin money,&#x201D; to be spent as they wished. How profitably I remember the way I envied those boys as I made out those checks each month. I often wondered why the hand of fate bore me into the world in poverty. I could look ahead and see how these boys would rise to the high stations in life while I remained a humble clerk.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ida06xip5ch">In due time the boys returned home with their &#x201C;sheep-skins.&#x201D; Their father was a wealthy man who owned banks and railroads and coal mines and other property of great value.

Their father has been bankrupted and his costly mansion, where the boys were born, has been placed on the block for sale.

Many a man has found his place in the world because of having been forced to struggle for existence early in life. Lack of knowledge of the advantages accruing from struggle has prompted many a parent to say, &#x201C;I had to work hard when I was young, <span class="itali">but</span> <span class="itali">I</span> <span class="itali">shall</span> <span class="itali">see</span> <span class="itali">to</span> <span class="itali">it</span> <span class="itali">that</span> <span class="itali">my</span> <span class="itali">children</span> <span class="itali">have</span> <span class="itali">an</span> <span class="itali">easy</span> <span class="itali">time!&#x201D;</span> Poor foolish creatures. An &#x201C;easy&#x201D; time usually turns out to be a greater handicap than the average young man or woman can survive. There are worse things in this world than being forced to work in early life. Forced idleness is far worse than forced labor. Being forced to work, and forced to <span class="itali">do</span> <span class="itali">your</span> <span class="itali">best,</span> will breed in you temperance and self-control and strength of will and content and a hundred other virtues which the idle will never know.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idbsyukhmji">Not only does lack of the necessity for struggle lead to weakness of ambition and willpower, but, what is more dangerous still, it sets up in a person&#x2019;s mind a state of lethargy that leads to the loss of Self-confidence. The person who has quit struggling because effort is no longer necessary is literally applying the principle of Auto-suggestion in undermining his own power of Self-confidence. Such a person will finally drift into a frame of mind in which he will actually look with more or less contempt upon the person who is forced to carry on.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id3k70mce8j">The human mind, if you will pardon repetition, may be likened to an electric battery. It may be positive or it may be negative. Self-confidence is the quality with which the mind is re-charged and made positive.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idcj6htlui2">Let us apply this line of reasoning to salesmanship and see what part Self-confidence plays in this great field of endeavor. One of the greatest salesmen this country has ever seen was once a clerk in a newspaper office.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id3d2wcq692">It will be worth your while to analyze the method through which he gained his title as &#x201C;the world&#x2019;s leading salesman.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idwvdzzuhex">He was a timid young man with a more or less retiring sort of nature. He was one of those who believe it best to slip in by the back door and take a seat at the rear of the stage of life. One evening he heard a lecture on the subject of this lesson, Self-confidence, and that lecture so impressed him that he left the lecture hall with a firm determination to pull himself out of the rut into which he had drifted.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idebe2oi6kp">He went to the Business Manager of the paper and asked for a position as solicitor of advertising and was put to work on a commission basis. Everyone in the office expected to see him fail, as this sort of salesmanship calls for the most positive type of sales ability. He went to his room and made out a list of a certain type of merchants on whom he intended to call. One would think that he would naturally have made up his list of the names of those whom he believed he could sell with the least effort, <span class="itali">but</span> <span class="itali">he</span> <span class="itali">did</span> <span class="itali">nothing</span> <span class="itali">of</span> <span class="itali">the</span> <span class="itali">sort.</span> He placed on his list only the names of the merchants on whom other advertising solicitors had called without making a sale. His list consisted of only twelve names. Before he made a single call he went out to the city park, took out his list of twelve names, read it over a hundred times, saying to himself as he did so, <span class="itali">&#x201C;You</span> <span class="itali">will</span> <span class="itali">purchase</span> <span class="itali">advertising</span> <span class="itali">space</span> <span class="itali">from</span> <span class="itali">me</span> <span class="itali">before</span> <span class="itali">the</span> <span class="itali">end</span> <span class="itali">of</span> <span class="itali">the</span> <span class="itali">month.&#x201D;</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idf4zclqorm">Then he began to make his calls. The first day he closed sales with three of the twelve &#x201C;impossibilities.&#x201D; During the remainder of the week he made sales to two others. By the end of the month he had opened advertising accounts with all but one of the merchants that he had on the list. For the ensuing month he made no sales, for the reason that he made no calls except on this one obstinate merchant. Every morning when the store opened he was on hand to interview this merchant and every morning the merchant said <span class="itali">&#x201C;No.&#x201D;</span> The merchant knew he was not going to buy advertising space, but this young man didn&#x2019;t know it. When the merchant said <span class="itali">No</span> the young man did not hear it, but kept right on coming. On the last day of the month, after having told this persistent young man <span class="itali">No</span> for thirty consecutive times, the merchant said:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1fi4voy87">&#x201C;Look here, young man, you have wasted a whole month trying to sell me; now, what I would like to know is this&#x2014;why have you wasted your time?&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id41p8vdbnr">&#x201C;Wasted my time nothing,&#x201D; he retorted; &#x201C;I have been going to school and you have been my teacher.

When he sat down to make up that list of twelve names he did something that ninety-nine people out of a hundred would not have done&#x2014;he selected the names of those whom he believed it would be hard to sell, because he understood that out of the resistance he would meet with in trying to sell them would come strength and Self-confidence.

It is your right and your duty to encourage your husband and urge him on in worthy undertakings until he shall have found his place in the world. You can induce him to put forth greater effort than can any other person in the world. Make him believe that nothing within reason is beyond his power of achievement and you will have rendered him a service that will go a long way toward helping him win in the battle of life.</p><p class="Blank-Space-BreakBsbrk" id="idior6rcyuu">[blank]</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idv9tylhq9b">One of the most successful men in his line in America gives entire credit for his success to his wife.

I believe in my employer. I believe in my friends. I believe in my family. I believe that God will lend me everything I need with which to succeed if I do my best to earn it through faithful and honest service. I believe in prayer and I will never close my eyes in sleep without praying for divine guidance to the end that I will be patient with other people and tolerant with those who do not believe as I do. I believe that success is the result of intelligent effort and does not depend upon luck or sharp practices or double-crossing friends, fellow men or my employer. I believe I will get out of life exactly what I put into it, therefore I will be careful to conduct myself toward others as I would want them to act toward me. I will not slander those whom I do not like. I will not slight my work no matter what I may see others doing. I will render the best service of which I am capable because I have pledged myself to succeed in life and I know that success is always the result of conscientious and efficient effort.

Keep a copy of it before you as a daily reminder of your pledge to practice it. By doing so you will be making efficient use of the principle of Auto-suggestion as a means of developing Self-confidence. Never mind what anyone may say about your procedure.

Select any two people of these two types that you choose, and study them, and the reason why one advances and the other stands still will be quite obvious to you. You will find that the one who advances <span class="itali">believes</span> <span class="itali">in</span> <span class="itali">himself.</span> You will find that he backs this belief with such dynamic, aggressive action that he lets others know that he believes in himself. You will also notice that this Self-confidence is contagious; it is impelling; it is persuasive; it attracts others.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idvvkqp1nhp">You will also find that the one who does not advance shows clearly, by the look on his face, by the posture of his body, by the lack of briskness in his step, by the uncertainty with which he speaks, that he lacks Self-confidence.

I have set a price on my services for each of these five years; a price that I intend to <span class="itali">earn</span> and <span class="itali">receive,</span> through strict application of the principle of efficient, satisfactory service which I will render in advance.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id8kj7ytzrr"><span class="itali">Fifth:</span> I fully realize that no wealth or position can long endure unless built upon truth and justice, therefore <span class="itali">I</span> <span class="itali">will</span> <span class="itali">engage</span> <span class="itali">in</span> <span class="itali">no</span> <span class="itali">transaction</span> <span class="itali">which</span> <span class="itali">does</span> <span class="itali">not</span> <span class="itali">benefit</span> <span class="itali">all</span> <span class="itali">whom</span> <span class="itali">it</span> <span class="itali">affects.</span> I will succeed by attracting to me the forces I wish to use, and the co-operation of other people. I will induce others to serve me because I will first serve them. I will eliminate hatred, envy, jealousy, selfishness and cynicism by developing love for all humanity, because I know that a negative attitude toward others can never bring me success. I will cause others to <span class="itali">believe</span> <span class="itali">in</span> <span class="itali">me</span> because I will believe in them and in myself.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idlc6q45m0p">I will sign my name to this formula, commit with full <span class="itali">faith</span> that it will gradually influence my entire life so that I will become a successful and happy worker in my chosen field of endeavor.</p><p class="SignatureSig" id="idr1jnjd07h">Signed.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. .&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. .&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. .&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. .&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. .&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id55h84jqk2">Before you sign your name to this formula make sure that you intend to carry out its instructions. Back of this formula lies a law that no man can explain. The psychologists refer to this law as Auto-suggestion and let it go at that, but you should bear in mind one point about which there is no uncertainty, and that is the fact that whatever this law is it <span class="itali">actually</span> <span class="itali">works!</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ido6bc7hzq6">Another point to be kept in mind is the fact that, just as electricity will turn the wheels of industry and serve mankind in a million other ways, or snuff out life if wrongly applied, so will this principle of Auto-suggestion lead you up the mountain-side of peace and prosperity, or down into the valley of misery and poverty, according to the application you make of it. If you fill your mind with doubt and unbelief in your ability to achieve, then the principle of Auto-suggestion takes this spirit of unbelief and sets it up in your subconscious mind as your dominating thought and slowly but surely draws you into the whirlpool of <span class="itali">failure.</span> But, if you fill your mind with radiant Self-confidence, the principle of Autosuggestion takes this belief and sets it up as your dominating thought and helps you master the obstacles that fall in your way until you reach the mountain-top of <span class="itali">success.</span></p><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="id7hvn1t86d">The Power of Habit</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idofpi650e9">Having, myself, experienced all the difficulties that stand in the road of those who lack the understanding to make practical application of this great principle of Auto-suggestion, let me take you a short way into the principle of habit, through the aid of which you may easily apply the principle of Auto-suggestion in any direction and for any purpose whatsoever.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idis5omj55d">Habit grows out of environment; out of doing the same thing or thinking the same thoughts or repeating the same words over and over again. Habit may be likened to the groove on a phonograph record, while the human mind may be likened to the needle that fits into that groove. When any habit has been well formed, through repetition of thought or action, the mind has a tendency to attach itself to and follow the course of that habit as closely as the phonograph needle follows the groove in the wax record.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idrhbnb6fmj">Habit is created by <span class="itali">repeatedly</span> directing one or more of the five senses of seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting and feeling, in a given direction. It is through this repetition principle that the injurious drug habit is formed. It is through this same principle that the desire for intoxicating drink is formed into a habit.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1zfnzbswv">After habit has been well established it will automatically control and direct our bodily activity, wherein may be found a thought that can be transformed into a powerful factor in the development of <span class="itali">Self-confidence.</span> The thought is this: <span class="itali">Voluntarily,</span> <span class="itali">and</span> <span class="itali">by</span> <span class="itali">force</span> <span class="itali">if</span> <span class="itali">necessary,</span> <span class="itali">direct</span> <span class="itali">your</span> <span class="itali">efforts</span> <span class="itali">and</span> <span class="itali">your</span> <span class="itali">thoughts</span> <span class="itali">along</span> <span class="itali">a</span> <span class="itali">desired</span> <span class="itali">line</span> <span class="itali">until</span> <span class="itali">you</span> <span class="itali">have</span> <span class="itali">formed</span> <span class="itali">the</span> <span class="itali">habit</span> <span class="itali">that</span> <span class="itali">will</span> <span class="itali">lay</span> <span class="itali">hold</span> <span class="itali">of</span> <span class="itali">you</span> <span class="itali">and</span> <span class="itali">continue,</span> <span class="itali">voluntarily,</span> <span class="itali">to</span> <span class="itali">direct</span> <span class="itali">your</span> <span class="itali">efforts</span> <span class="itali">along</span> <span class="itali">the</span> <span class="itali">same</span> <span class="itali">line.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idhas3z10ss">The object in writing out and repeating the Self-confidence formula is to form the habit of making <span class="itali">belief</span> <span class="itali">in</span> <span class="itali">yourself</span> the dominating thought of your mind until that thought has been thoroughly imbedded in your subconscious mind, through the principle of <span class="itali">habit.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idt04mydh2u">You learned to write by repeatedly directing the muscles of your arm and hand over certain outlines known as letters, until finally you formed the habit of tracing these outlines. Now you write with ease and rapidity, without tracing each letter slowly. Writing has become a <span class="itali">habit</span> with you.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ideapb1nlpz">The principle of habit will lay hold of the faculties of your mind just the same as it will influence the physical muscles of your body, as you can easily prove by mastering and applying this lesson on Self-confidence. Any statement that you repeatedly make to yourself, or any <span class="itali">desire</span> that you deeply plant in your mind through repeated statement, will eventually seek expression through your physical, outward bodily efforts. The principle of habit is the very foundation upon which this lesson on Self-confidence is built, and if you will understand and follow the directions laid down in this lesson you will soon know more about the law of habit, from first-hand knowledge, than could be taught you by a thousand such lessons as this.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idhqt41jaqp">You have but little conception of the possibilities which lie sleeping within you, awaiting but the awakening hand of vision to arouse you, and you will never have a better conception of those possibilities unless you develop sufficient Self-confidence to lift you above the commonplace influences of your present environment.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ide9a414k3s">The human mind is a marvelous, mysterious piece of machinery, a fact of which I was reminded a few months ago when I picked up Emerson&#x2019;s <span class="itali">Essays</span> and re-read his essay on Spiritual Laws. A strange thing happened. I saw in that essay, which I had read scores of times previously, much that I had never noticed before. I saw more in this essay than I had seen during previous readings because the unfoldment of my mind since the last reading had prepared me to interpret more.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id5gxyx9z1t">The human mind is constantly unfolding, like the petals of a flower, until it reaches the maximum of development. What this maximum is, where it ends, or whether it ends at all or not, are unanswerable questions, but the degree of unfoldment seems to vary according to the nature of the individual and the degree to which he keeps his mind at work. A mind that is forced or coaxed into analytical thought every day seems to keep on unfolding and developing greater powers of interpretation.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idohqqivz2j">Down in Louisville, Kentucky, lives Mr. Lee Cook, a man who has practically no legs and has to wheel himself around on a cart.

Lying flat on his back in bed, Mr. Jones made that brain create a <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">purpose.</span> That purpose was prosaic and humble enough in nature, but it was <span class="itali">definite</span> and it was a <span class="itali">purpose,</span> something that he had never known before.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idtfhavnj1i">His <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">purpose</span> was to make pork sausage.

The incident to which I refer happened in the city of Chicago, while I was engaged in the work of character analysis. One day a tramp presented himself at my office and asked for an interview. As I looked up from my work and greeted him he said, &#x201C;I have come to see the man who wrote this little book,&#x201D; as he removed from his pocket a copy of a book entitled Self-confidence, which I had written many years previously. &#x201C;It must have been the hand of fate,&#x201D; he continued, &#x201C;that slipped this book into my pocket yesterday afternoon, because I was about ready to go out there and punch a hole in Lake Michigan. I had about come to the conclusion that everything and everybody, including God, had it in for me until I read this book, and it gave me a new viewpoint and brought me the courage and the hope that sustained me through the night. I made up my mind that if I could see the man who wrote this book he could help me get on my feet again. Now, I am here and I would like to know what you can do for a man like me.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idm4tts82vk">While he was speaking I had been studying him from head to foot, and I am frank to admit that down deep in my heart I did not believe there was anything I could do for him, but I did not wish to tell him so. The glassy stare in his eyes, the lines of discouragement in his face, the posture of his body, the ten days&#x2019; growth of beard on his face, the nervous manner about this man all conveyed to me the impression that he was hopeless, but I did not have the heart to tell him so, therefore I asked him to sit down and tell me his whole story. I asked him to be perfectly frank and tell me, as nearly as possible, just what had brought him down to the ragged edge of life. I promised him that after I had heard his entire story I would then tell him whether or not I could be of service to him. He related his story, in lengthy detail, the sum and substance of which was this: He had invested his entire fortune in a small manufacturing business. When the world war began in 1914, it was impossible for him to get the raw materials necessary in the operation of his factory, and he therefore failed. The loss of his money broke his heart and so disturbed his mind that he left his wife and children and became a tramp.

I pulled the curtain aside and uncovered a tall looking-glass in which he saw himself from head to foot. Pointing my finger at the glass I said:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idsyogx6dtr">&#x201C;There stands the man to whom I promised to introduce you. There is the only man in this world who can put you back on your feet again, and unless you sit down and become acquainted with that man, as you never became acquainted with him before, you might just as well go on over and &#x2018;punch a hole&#x2019; in Lake Michigan, because you will be of no value to yourself or to the world until you know this man better.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idveyp0n60k">He stepped over to the glass, rubbed his hands over his bearded face, studied himself from head to foot for a few moments, then stepped back, dropped his head and began to weep. I knew that the lesson had been driven home, so I led him back to the elevator and sent him away. I never expected to see him again, and I doubted that the lesson would be sufficient to help him regain his place in the world, because he seemed to be too far gone for redemption. He seemed to be not only <span class="itali">down,</span> but almost <span class="itali">out.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idd4psfdx54">A few days later I met this man on the street. His transformation had been so complete that I hardly recognized him. He was walking briskly, with his head tilted back. That old, shifting, nervous posture of his body was gone. He was dressed in new clothes from head to foot. He looked prosperous and he felt prosperous. He stopped me and related what had happened to bring about his rapid transformation from a state of abject failure to one of hope and promise.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id8tlal052z">&#x201C;I was just on my way to your office,&#x201D; he explained, &#x201C;to bring you the good news. I went out the very day that I was in your office, a down-and-out tramp, and despite my appearance I sold myself at a salary of $3,000.00 a year. <span class="itali">Think</span> <span class="itali">of</span> <span class="itali">it,</span> <span class="itali">man,</span> <span class="itali">three</span> <span class="itali">thousand</span> <span class="itali">dollars</span> <span class="itali">a</span> <span class="itali">year!</span> And my employer advanced me money enough with which to buy some new clothes, as you can see for yourself. He also advanced me some money to send home to my family, and I am once more on the road to success. It seems like a dream when I think that only a few days ago I had lost hope and faith and courage, and was actually contemplating suicide.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2596ia742">&#x201C;I was coming to tell you that one of these days, when you are least expecting me, I will pay you another visit, and when I do I will be a successful man. I will bring with me a check, signed in blank and made payable to you, and you may fill in the amount because you have saved me from <span class="itali">myself</span> by introducing me to <span class="itali">myself</span>&#x2014;that self which I never knew until you stood me in front of that looking-glass and pointed out the <span class="itali">real</span> me.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idzpxcghctt">As that man turned and departed in the crowded streets of Chicago I saw, for the first time in my life, what strength and power and possibility lie hidden in the mind of the man who has never discovered the value of <span class="itali">Self-reliance.</span> Then and there I made up my mind that I, too, would stand in front of that same looking-glass and point an accusing finger at myself for not having discovered the lesson which I had helped another to learn. I did stand before that same looking-glass, and as I did so I then and there fixed in my mind, as my <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">purpose</span> in life, the determination to help men and women discover the forces that lie sleeping within them. The book you hold in your hands is evidence that my definite purpose is being carried out.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idaayfb0vbx">The man whose story I have related is now the president of one of the largest and most successful concerns of its kind in America, with a business that extends from coast to coast and from Canada to Mexico.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idd8is4pde6">A short while after the incident just related, a woman came to my office for personal analysis. She was then a teacher in the Chicago public schools. I gave her an analysis chart and asked her to fill it out. She had been at work on the chart but a few minutes when she came back to my desk, handed back the chart and said, &#x201C;I do not believe I will fill this out.&#x201D; I asked her why she had decided not to fill out the chart and she replied: &#x201C;To be perfectly frank with you, one of the questions in this chart put me to thinking and I now know what is wrong with me, therefore I feel it unnecessary to pay you a fee to analyze me.&#x201D; With that the woman went away and I did not hear from her for two years. She went to New York City, became a writer of advertising copy for one of the largest agencies in the country and her income at the time she wrote me was $10,000.00 a year.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idk5ro8dej3">This woman sent me a check to cover the cost of my analysis fee, because she felt that the fee had been earned, even though I did not render her the service that I usually render my clients. It is impossible for anyone to foretell what seemingly insignificant incident may lead to an important turning-point in one&#x2019;s career, but there is no denying the fact that these &#x201C;turning-points&#x201D; may be more readily recognized by those who have well-rounded-out confidence in themselves.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idr066bdius">One of the irreparable losses to the human race lies in the lack of knowledge that there is a definite method through which Self-confidence can be developed in any person of average intelligence. What an immeasurable loss to civilization that young men and women are not taught this known method of developing Self-confidence before they complete their schooling, for no one who lacks faith in himself is really educated in the proper sense of the term.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id3wnimd26m">Oh, what glory and satisfaction would be the happy heritage of the man or woman who could pull aside the curtain of <span class="itali">fear</span> that hangs over the human race and shuts out the sunlight of understanding that Self-confidence brings, wherever it is in evidence.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idigpto1low">Where <span class="itali">fear</span> controls, noteworthy achievement becomes an impossibility, a fact which brings to mind the definition of <span class="itali">fear,</span> as stated by a great philosopher:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idbss1bh46m">&#x201C;Fear is the dungeon of the mind into which it runs and hides and seeks seclusion. Fear brings on superstition and superstition is the dagger with which hypocrisy assassinates the soul.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idku67amzmc">In front of the typewriter on which I am writing the manuscripts for this Reading Course hangs a sign with the following wording, in big letters:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idsnqnfldg9">&#x201C;Day by day in every way I am becoming more <span class="itali">successful</span>.&#x201D;</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="id8dlrh0k2g">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="id5eny395ac">Love, beauty, joy and worship are forever building, tearing down and rebuilding the foundation of each man&#x2019;s soul.</p><p class="ENDEND" id="idnj1po969n">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ideaeaho7js">A skeptic who read that sign asked if I really believed &#x201C;that stuff&#x201D; and I replied, &#x201C;Of course not. All it ever did for me was to help me get out of the coal mines, where I started as a laborer, and find a place in the world in which I am serving upwards of 100,000 people, in whose minds I am planting the same positive thought that this sign brings out; therefore, why should I believe in it?&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idk9i6iw6t8">As this man started to leave he said: &#x201C;Well, perhaps there is something to this sort of philosophy, after all, for I have always been afraid that I would be a failure, and so far my fears have been thoroughly realized.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id6x07dj3yq">You are condemning yourself to poverty, misery and failure, or you are driving yourself on toward the heights of great achievement, solely by the thoughts you think. If you <span class="itali">demand</span> success of yourself and back up this demand with intelligent action you are sure to win. Bear in mind, though, that there is a difference between <span class="itali">demanding</span> success and just merely wishing for it. You should find out what this difference is, and take advantage of it.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1ax6wq7g6">Do you remember what the Bible says (look it up, somewhere in the book of Matthew) about those who have faith as a grain of mustard seed? Go at the task of developing Self-confidence with at least that much faith if not more. Never mind &#x201C;what <span class="itali">they</span> will say&#x201D; because you might as well know that <span class="itali">&#x201C;they&#x201D;</span> will be of little aid to you in your climb up the mountain-side of life toward the object of your <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">purpose.</span> You have within you all the power you need with which to get whatever you want or need in this world, and about the best way to avail yourself of this power is to <span class="itali">believe</span> <span class="itali">in</span> <span class="itali">yourself.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idwh9eiqwv2">&#x201C;Know thyself, man; know thyself.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id6pavwgy9k">This has been the advice of the philosophers all down the ages. When you <span class="itali">really</span> know yourself you will know that there is nothing foolish about hanging a sign in front of you that reads like this: &#x201C;Day by day in every way I am becoming more successful,&#x201D; with due apologies to the Frenchman who made this motto popular. I am not afraid to place this sort of suggestion in front of my desk, and, what is more to the point, I am not afraid to believe that it will influence me so that I will become a more positive and aggressive human being.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id985nd6uql">More than twenty-five years ago I learned my first lesson in Self-confidence building. One night I was sitting before an open fire-place, listening to a conversation between some older men, on the subject of Capital and Labor. Without invitation I joined in the conversation and said something about employers and employees settling their differences on the Golden Rule basis. My remarks attracted the attention of one of the men, who turned to me, with a look of surprise on his face and said:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idtln5ffq3e">&#x201C;Why, you are a bright boy, and if you would go out and get a schooling you would make your mark in the world.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idesv6f87xo">Those remarks fell on &#x201C;fertile&#x201D; ears, even though that was the first time anyone had ever told me that I was bright, or that I might accomplish anything worthwhile in life. The remark put me to thinking, and the more I allowed my mind to dwell upon that thought the more certain I became that the remark had back of it a possibility.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id53usgo8q6">It might be truthfully stated that whatever service I am rendering the world and whatever good I accomplish, should be credited to that off-hand remark.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idlgyaxc5it">Suggestions such as this are often powerful, and none the less so when they are deliberate and self-expressed. Go back, now, to the Self-confidence formula and master it, for it will lead you into the &#x201C;power-house&#x201D; of your own mind, where you will tap a force that can be made to carry you to the very top of the Ladder of Success.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idufnb3eu91">Others will believe in you only when you believe in yourself. They will &#x201C;tune in&#x201D; on your thoughts and feel toward you just as you feel toward yourself. The law of mental telepathy takes care of this. You are continuously broadcasting what you think of yourself, and if you have no faith in yourself others will pick up the vibrations of your thoughts and mistake them for their own. Once understand the law of mental telepathy and you will know why Self-confidence is the second of the Fifteen Laws of Success.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idpauc3fvan">You should be cautioned, however, to learn the difference between Self-confidence, which is based upon sound knowledge of what you know and what you can do, and egotism, which is only based upon what you <span class="itali">wish</span> you knew or could do. Learn the difference between these two terms or you will make yourself boresome, ridiculous and annoying to people of culture and understanding. Self-confidence is something which should never be proclaimed or announced except through intelligent performance of constructive deeds.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id4wcxf2rot">If you have Self-confidence those around you will discover this fact. Let them make the discovery. They will feel proud of their alertness in having made the discovery, and you will be free from the suspicion of egotism. Opportunity never stalks the person with a highly developed state of egotism, but brick-bats and ugly remarks do. Opportunity forms affinities much more easily and quickly with Self-confidence than it does with egotism. Self-praise is never a proper measure of self-reliance. Bear this in mind and let your Self-confidence speak only through the tongue of constructive service rendered without fuss or flurry.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idhxu51rm3a">Self-confidence is the product of knowledge. Know yourself, know how much you know (and how little), why you know it, and how you are going to use it. &#x201C;Four-flushers&#x201D; come to grief, therefore, do not pretend to know more than you actually do know. There&#x2019;s no use of pretense, because any educated person will measure you quite accurately after hearing you speak for three minutes. What you really are will speak so loudly that what you &#x201C;claim&#x201D; you are will not be heard.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id47hqojouh">If you heed this warning the last four pages of this one lesson may mark one of the most important turning-points of your life.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idwjo2r3v4x">Believe in yourself, but do not tell the world what you can do&#x2014;SHOW IT!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idxx7yo6y64">You are now ready for Lesson Three, which will take you the next step up the Ladder of Success.</p><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="idslfzsc2m4">DISCONTENTMENT</p><p class="B-HeadBhead" id="iddyb55pwij">An After-the-Lesson Visit with the Author</p><p class="Design-NoteDn" id="iddfh7rlp7n">[Art 2]</p><p class="CaptionCap" id="idncj3znvmn">The marker stands at the Entrance Gate of Life and writes &#x201C;Poor Fool&#x201D; on the brow of the wise man and &#x201C;Poor Sinner&#x201D; on the brow of the saint.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2gx32eg46">The supreme mystery of the universe is life!

Through repetition, any act indulged in a few times becomes a habit, and the mind appears to be nothing more than a mass of motivating forces growing out of our daily habits.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddoum6tbop">When once fixed in the mind a habit voluntarily impels one to action. For example, follow a given route to your daily work, or to some other place that you frequently visit, and very soon the habit has been formed and your mind will lead you over that route without thought on your part. Moreover, if you start out with the intention of traveling in another direction, without keeping the thought of the change in routes constantly in mind, you will find yourself following the old route.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idlabo9o2gd">Public speakers have found that the telling over and over again of a story, which may be based upon pure fiction, brings into play the Law of Habit, and very soon they forget whether the story is true or not.</p><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="idh9cpaao2l">Walls of Limitation Built Through Habit</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9odqyzc6c">Millions of people go through life in poverty and want because they have made destructive use of the Law of Habit.

Your subconscious mind takes over this picture which you have created and uses it as a blueprint, chart or map by which to mold your thoughts and actions into practical plans for attaining the object of your Chief Aim, or purpose. Through the Law of Habit you keep the object of your Definite Chief Aim fixed in your mind (in the manner described in Lesson One) until it becomes firmly and permanently implanted there. This practice will destroy the poverty consciousness and set up, in its place, a prosperity consciousness. You will actually begin to DEMAND prosperity, you will begin to expect it, you will begin to prepare yourself to receive it and to use it wisely, thus paving the way or setting the stage for the development of the Habit of Saving.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ide55nyw2af"><span class="itali">Second,</span> having in this manner increased your earning power you will make further use of the Law of Habit by provision, in your written statement of your Definite Chief Aim, for saving a definite proportion of all the money you earn.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idryh4bh8pw">Therefore, as your earnings increase, your savings will, likewise, increase in proportion.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idc3xyfzrd5">By ever urging yourself on and demanding of yourself increased earning power, on the one hand, and by systematically laying aside a definite amount of all your earnings, on the other hand, you will soon reach the point at which you have removed all imaginary limitations from your own mind and you will then be well started on the road toward financial independence.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idik62gw8o3">Nothing could be more practical or more easily accomplished than this!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idmlw90aj89">Reverse the operation of the Law of Habit, by setting up in your mind the Fear of Poverty, and very soon this fear will reduce your earning capacity until you will be barely able to earn sufficient money to take care of your actual necessities.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idzh0umyr2f">The publishers of newspapers could create a panic in a week&#x2019;s time by filling their columns with news items concerning the actual business failures of the country, despite the fact that but few businesses, compared to the total number in existence, actually fail.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idfvltx56ed">The so-called &#x201C;crime waves&#x201D; are very largely the products of sensational journalism.

His wife loves &#x201C;society&#x201D; and tries to make a $20,000 showing on a $12,000 income, with the result that this poor fellow is usually about $8,000 in debt.

The children, two girls and one boy, are now of the age when they are thinking of going to college, but this is impossible because of the father&#x2019;s debts. The result is dissension between the father and his children which makes the entire family unhappy and miserable.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id66vs3w33g">It is a terrible thing even to think of going through life like a prisoner in chains, bound down and owned by somebody else on account of debts. The accumulation of debts is a habit. It starts in a small way and grows to enormous proportions slowly, step by step, until finally it takes charge of one&#x2019;s very soul.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id6c6fh9huz">Thousands of young men start their married lives with unnecessary debts hanging over their heads and never manage to get out from under the load. After the novelty of marriage begins to wear off (as it usually does) the married couple begin to feel the embarrassment of want, and this feeling grows until it leads, oftentimes, to open dissatisfaction with one another, and eventually to the divorce court.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idcxo7yoosw">A man who is bound by the slavery of debt has no time or inclination to set up or work out ideals, with the result that he drifts downward with time until he eventually begins to set up limitations in his own mind, and by these he hedges himself behind prison walls of FEAR and doubt from which he never escapes.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idrf1wolle4">No sacrifice is too great to avoid the misery of debt!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idllpj8ul5z">&#x201C;Think of what you owe yourself and those who are dependent upon you and resolve to be no man&#x2019;s debtor,&#x201D; is the advice of one very successful man whose early chances were destroyed by debt. This man came to himself soon enough to throw off the habit of buying that which he did not need and eventually worked his way out of slavery.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id8ckwn1enw">Most men who develop the habit of debt will not be so fortunate as to come to their senses in time to save themselves, because debt is something like quicksand in that it has a tendency to draw its victim deeper and deeper into the mire.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idll9fni59u">The Fear of Poverty is one of the most destructive of the six basic fears described in Lesson Two. The man who becomes hopelessly in debt is seized with this poverty fear, his ambition and self-confidence become paralyzed, and he sinks gradually into oblivion.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idajo7rf74x">There are two classes of debts, and these are so different in nature that they deserve to be here described, as follows:</p><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="id6cty6q6fw"><span class="boldb">1. </span>There are debts incurred for luxuries which become a dead loss.</p><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idc34qha4r6"><span class="boldb">2. </span>There are debts incurred in the course of professional or business trading which represent service or merchandise that can be converted back into assets.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idw9i4y9638">The first class of debts is the one to be avoided. The second class may be indulged in, providing the one incurring the debts uses judgment and does not go beyond the bounds of reasonable limitation. The moment one buys beyond his limitations he enters the realm of speculation, and speculation swallows more of its victims than it enriches.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ideuwro3rj7">Practically all people who live beyond their means are tempted to speculate with the hope that they may recoup, at a single turn of the wheel of fortune, so to speak, their entire indebtedness. The wheel generally stops at the wrong place and, far from finding themselves out of debt, such people as indulge in speculation are bound more closely as slaves of debt.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idlyya6r4zy">The Fear of Poverty breaks down the will-power of its victims, and they then find themselves unable to restore their lost fortunes, and, what is still more sad, they lose all ambition to extricate themselves from the slavery of debt.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idtu2lpxw9p">Hardly a day passes that one may not see an account in the newspapers of at least one suicide as the result of worry over debts. The slavery of debt causes more suicides every year than all other causes combined, which is a slight indication of the cruelty of the poverty fear.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idyjy6o1kl4">During the war millions of men faced the front-line trenches without flinching, knowing that death might overtake them any moment. Those same men, when facing the Fear of Poverty, often cringe and out of sheer desperation, which paralyzes their reason, sometimes commit suicide.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idxuoq88vur">The person who is free from debt may whip poverty and achieve outstanding financial success, but, if he is bound by debt, such achievement is but a remote possibility, and never a probability.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddsjajr8en">Fear of Poverty is a negative, destructive state of mind. Moreover, one negative state of mind has a tendency to attract other similar states of mind. For example, the Fear of Poverty may attract the fear of Ill Health, and these two may attract the Fear of Old Age, so that the victim finds himself poverty-stricken, in ill health and actually growing old long before the time when he should begin to show the signs of old age.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2pos4d6uu">Millions of untimely, nameless graves have been filled by this cruel state of mind known as the Fear of Poverty!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id5sto4kqeq">Less than a dozen years ago a young man held a responsible position with the City National Bank, of New York City. Through living beyond his income he contracted a large amount of debts which caused him to worry until this destructive habit began to show up in his work and he was dismissed from the bank&#x2019;s service.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id4wb4p6x7p">He secured another position, at less money, but his creditors embarrassed him so that he decided to resign and go away into another city, where he hoped to escape them until he had accumulated enough money to pay off his indebtedness. Creditors have a way of tracing debtors, so very soon they were close on the heels of this young man, whose employer found out about his indebtedness and dismissed him from his position.</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="id5nr21kd5r">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="idjt3j26mwz">Who told you it couldn&#x2019;t be done? and, what great achievement has he to his credit that entitles him to use the word &#x201C;impossible&#x201D; so freely?</p><p class="ENDEND" id="idfo5l27cn4">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id4ce28z4ui">He then searched in vain for employment for two months.

First, quit the habit of buying on credit, and follow this by gradually paying off the debts that you have already incurred.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddllax8l2b">Being free from the worry of indebtedness you are ready to revamp the habits of your mind and re-direct your course toward prosperity. Adopt, as a part of your Definite Chief Aim, the habit of saving a regular proportion of your income, even if this be no more than a penny a day. Very soon this habit will begin to lay hold of your mind and you will actually get joy out of saving.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id17qwcytej">Any habit may be discontinued by building in its place some other and more desirable habit. The &#x201C;spending&#x201D; habit must be replaced by the &#x201C;saving&#x201D; habit by all who attain financial independence.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2o45txpr3">Merely to discontinue an undesirable habit is not enough, as such habits have a tendency to reappear unless the place they formerly occupied in the mind is filled by some other habit of a different nature.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idv2o9286kd">The discontinuance of a habit leaves a &#x201C;hole&#x201D; in the mind, and this hole must be filled up with some other form of habit or the old one will return and claim its place.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idikbffsgu0">Throughout this course many psychological formulas, which the student has been requested to memorize and practice, have been described.

The first question that arises, in the minds of most people, when they meet a stranger, is, &#x201C;How much money has he?&#x201D; If he has money he is welcomed into homes and business opportunities are thrown his way. All sorts of attention are lavished upon him. He is a prince, and as such is entitled to the best of the land.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idhcsuny09k">But if his shoes are run down at the heels, his clothes are not pressed, his collar is dirty, and he shows plainly the signs of impoverished finances, woe be his lot, for the passing crowd will step on his toes and blow the smoke of disrespect in his face.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idcux5rb7kg">These are not pretty statements, but they have one virtue&#x2014;THEY ARE TRUE!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idinl2quttj">This tendency to judge people by the money they have, or their power to control money, is not confined to any one class of people.

Without a savings fund the individual suffers in two ways: first, by inability to seize opportunities that come only to the person with some ready cash, and, second, by embarrassment due to some unexpected emergency calling for cash.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1mp76nrm5">It might be said, also, that the individual suffers in still a third respect by not developing the Habit of Saving, through lack of certain other qualities essential for success which grow out of the practice of the Habit of Saving.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idytsy0mf68">The nickels, dimes and pennies which the average person allows to slip through his fingers would, if systematically saved and properly put to work, eventually bring financial independence.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idzxpynmhdf">Through the courtesy of a prominent Building and Loan Association<span class="custom_note_mark">*</span><span class="FootnoteReference FootnoteRef" id="footnote_1">1</span> the following table has been compiled, showing what a monthly saving of $5.00, $10.00, $25.00 or $50.00 will amount to at the end of ten years.

This may be true enough, as far as the reasoning goes (which is not very far) but the other side of the story is that the saving of even a small sum of money places one in position where, oftentimes, this small sum may enable one to take advantage of business opportunities which lead directly and quite rapidly to financial independence.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9buzwh2h4">The foregoing table, showing what a saving of $5.00 a month will amount to at the end of ten years, should be copied and pasted on your mirror, where it will stare you in the face every morning when you get up and every night as you retire, providing you have not already acquired the habit of systematic saving of money.

Also men who have had millions of dollars, all of which passed through their fingers and they are now penniless.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idmyoaox5mt">For the purpose of showing the student of this philosophy just how the law of habit becomes a sort of pivotal point on which success or failure turns, and exactly why no man can become financially independent without developing the habit of SYSTEMATIC SAVING, the living habits of some of these many acquaintances will be described.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id3x1ext1o3">We will begin with a complete history, in his own words, of a man who has made a million dollars in the field of advertising, but who now has nothing to show for his efforts. This story first appeared in the <span class="itali">American</span> <span class="itali">Magazine,</span> and it is here reprinted through the courtesy of the publishers of that publication.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idw85nim7q5">The story is true, in every respect, and it has been included as a part of this lesson because the author of the story, Mr. W. C. Freeman, is willing to have his mistakes made public with the hope that others may avoid them.</p><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="id5en976rup">&#x201C;I Have Made a Million Dollars But I Haven&#x2019;t Got a Cent&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iduycksmy3m">While it is embarrassing, yes, humiliating, publicly to confess to an outstanding fault that has made a good deal of a mess of my life today, nevertheless I have decided to make this confession for the good it may do.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idz7sb808wm">I am going to make a clean breast of how I let slip through my fingers all the money I have earned thus far in my life-time, which approximates one million dollars. This amount I made through my work in the field of advertising, except a few thousand dollars I earned up to twenty-five years of age by teaching in country schools and by writing news letters to some country weeklies and daily newspapers.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idnh4lqv330">Maybe one lone million does not seem a lot of money in these days of many millions and even billions; but it is a big sum of money, just the same. If there are any who think to the contrary, let them count a million. I tried to figure out the other night how long it would take to do so. I found I could count an average of one hundred a minute. On this basis it would take me twenty days of eight hours each, plus six hours and forty minutes on the twenty-first day to do the stunt. I doubt very much if you or I were given an assignment to count one million one-dollar bills, upon the promise that all of them would be ours at the end of that time, that we could complete it. It would probably drive us mad&#x2014;and a lot of use the money would be to us then, wouldn&#x2019;t it?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idoif6gspt7">Let me say at the outset of my story that I do not regret, not for one minute, that I spent ninety per cent of the money I made. To wish any of this ninety per cent back at this time would make me feel that I would have denied much happiness to my family and to many others.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idnadvm8k8n">My only regret is that I spent <span class="itali">all</span> of my money, and more besides. If I had today the ten per cent I could have saved easily, I would have one hundred thousand dollars safely invested, and no debts. If I had this money I would feel really and truly that I was rich; and I mean just this, for I have never had a desire to accumulate money for money&#x2019;s sake.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id4k9hbdjp1">Those school-teaching and newspaper-correspondence days of mine brought some cares and responsibilities, but they were met optimistically.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idpy5atfy9u">I married at the age of twenty-one, with the full approval of parents on both sides, who believed thoroughly in the doctrine preached by Henry Ward Beecher, that &#x201C;early marriages are virtuous marriages.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idf2pv8mboo">Just one month and one day after I was married my father met a tragic death. He was suffocated by coal gas. Having been an educator all his life&#x2014;and one of the best&#x2014;he had not accumulated any money.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idob2gaxq2e">When he passed out of our family circle it was up to all of us to pull together and get along somehow, which we did.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id7yalvlnw5">Apart from the void left in our home by my father&#x2019;s death (my wife and I and my mother and only sister lived together), we had a joyful life, despite the fact that it was a tight squeeze to make ends meet.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id7mrmla0mc">My mother, who was exceptionally talented and resourceful (she had taught school with my father until I was born), decided to open our home to a married couple, old friends of the family. They came to live with us and their board helped to pay expenses. My mother was known far and wide for the wonderful meals she served. Later on, two well-to-do women friends of the family were taken into our home; thus increasing our revenue.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idykp9er3zq">My sister helped very substantially by teaching a kindergarten class, which met in the big living-room of our home; my wife contributed her share to the household by taking charge of the sewing and mending.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idbzdx8ojqm">Those were very happy days. Nobody in the household was extravagant or had any extravagant tendencies except perhaps myself, for I was always inclined to be free with money. I liked to make gifts to the family and to entertain friends.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idae14c6hib">When the first baby came into our home&#x2014;a boy&#x2014;we all thought heaven had opened its doors to us. My wife&#x2019;s parents, who took the keenest and deepest interest in our affairs, and who were always ready to lend a helping hand, were equally happy over the coming of their first grandchild. My brother-in-law, much older than my wife, and a bachelor, could not understand at first the joy we all felt; but even he began to strut around like a proud peacock after a while. What a difference a baby makes in a home!</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="id70gsheswe">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="idlnm148lwx">Think well before you speak because your words may plant the seed of either success or failure in the mind of some other person.</p><p class="ENDEND" id="idrwoxgi9fv">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idtsecbqo1a">I am injecting these details into my story merely to emphasize how the early days of my life were lived. I had no opportunity to spend much money, and yet I had as much happiness in those days as I have ever had since.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idjn0tyfnig">The strange thing about it all is that the experience of those days did not teach me the value of money. If anybody ever had a practical lesson to guide him in his future, I certainly had it.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idpz67roh3p">But let me tell you how this early experience affected me. The birth of my son inspired me to do something that would make more money than I was getting at teaching school and in writing for newspapers. I did not want my wife, mother and sister to feel that they would have to continue indefinitely to do their part in sustaining the household. Why should a fellow, big and strong and healthy as I have always been, and with a reasonable amount of ability, be content to remain a spoke in the wheel? Why shouldn&#x2019;t I be the whole wheel, as far as providing for the family was concerned?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idmn0wa8o23">Following my desire to make more money, I took on the selling of books in addition to teaching and writing for newspapers. This earned for me quite a little extra money. Finally, I gave up teaching and concentrated on selling books, and writing for newspapers.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idscckuidqe">My book-selling took me to Bridgeton, New Jersey. It was here that I got my first real start in making money. I had to be away from home a great deal to do this work, but the sacrifice was worthwhile. I earned enough money in a few weeks to send more money home than I had contributed to the household in any year from my school-teaching and newspaper correspondence. After combing the territory in the Bridgeton zone, I became interested in a newspaper in that city, the <span class="itali">Morning</span> <span class="itali">Star.</span> It seemed to me that the editor and publisher of this paper needed a helper. I called on him and told him so. He said, &#x201C;Heavens, young man, how can I hire you? I am not earning enough money to pay for my own living!&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idyd0nsqj2o">&#x201C;That&#x2019;s just it,&#x201D; said I. &#x201C;I believe together we can make the <span class="itali">Star</span> a success. I&#x2019;ll tell you what I&#x2019;ll do: I&#x2019;ll work for you for one week for one dollar a day. At the end of the week, if I have made good, I&#x2019;ll expect you to pay me three dollars a day for the second week; and then, if I continue to do well, I&#x2019;ll expect you to pay me six dollars a day for the third week, and will continue from then on until the paper makes enough money to pay me fifty dollars a week.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id6ew1aqvjx">The owner agreed to my proposition. At the end of two months, I was being paid fifty dollars a week, which in those days was considered a big salary. I began to feel that I was well on my way toward making money&#x2014;but all I wanted it for was to make my family more comfortable. Fifty dollars a week was just four times as much as I had made teaching school.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idsj4jac2ga">My job on the <span class="itali">Star</span> embraced editorial writing (not very brilliant), reporting (just ordinary), the writing and selling of advertisements (fairly successful), proof reading, bill collecting, and so forth. It kept me humping six days a week; but I could stand it, for I was strong and healthy, and, besides, the work was very interesting. I also contributed correspondence to the <span class="itali">New</span> <span class="itali">York</span> <span class="itali">Sun,</span> <span class="itali">Philadelphia</span> <span class="itali">Record,</span> and the Trenton (N. J.) <span class="itali">Times</span>, which brought me in an average of one hundred and fifty dollars a month, for this was a good news territory.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idyxphr1w51">I learned a lesson on the Star which eventually shaped the course of my life. I found out that there is a great deal more money to be earned by selling advertising for newspapers than in writing for them. Advertising brings grist to the mill.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idq47turb3t">I put over one advertising stunt on the <span class="itali">Star</span>&#x2014;a write-up of the south Jersey oyster industry, paid for by the oyster men&#x2014;that brought in three thousand dollars cash, which the publisher divided with me fifty-fifty. I had never seen so much money at one time in all my life. Think of it! Fifteen hundred dollars&#x2014;twenty-five per cent more than I had made in two years of school-teaching and odd tasks.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id320i1pv2n">Did I save this money or any part of it? I did not. What was the use? I could do so much with it to make my wife, boy, mother and sister happy that I let it go far easier than I had made it.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id28n1hu212">But would it not have been a fine thing if I had put this money away for a rainy day?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id5bivwbvxd">My work in Bridegton attracted the attention of Sam Hudson, New Jersey correspondent of the <span class="itali">Philadelphia</span> <span class="itali">Record</span>, who was a shining example of that type of newspaper men whose greatest pleasure in life is doing things for others.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idi5rkvygw0">Sam told me that it was time for me to get located in a big city. He thought I had it in me to make good. He said he would get me a job in Philadelphia. He did, and I moved with my wife and baby to Germantown. I was given charge of the advertising department of the Germantown (Philadelphia) <span class="itali">Gazette</span>, a weekly newspaper.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idnt5xofctl">At the start I did not make as much money as I had earned in Bridegton, because I had to give up my newspaper correspondence. The news for this section was covered by other correspondents. But very soon I was making twenty-five per cent more money. The <span class="itali">Gazette</span> increased its size three times to accommodate its advertising, and each time I received a very substantial increase in salary.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idrcfne6bg6">In addition to this, I was given a job to gather social news for the Sunday edition of the <span class="itali">Philadelphia</span> <span class="itali">Press.</span> Bradford Merrill, managing editor of that newspaper, now a very important New York newspaper executive, assigned me a big territory to cover. This kept me busy every night in the week except Saturdays. I was paid five dollars a column; but I averaged seven columns every Sunday; which made me thirty-five dollars a week extra.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idem9s3sl6d">It was more money for me to spend, and I spent it. I did not know anything about budgeting my expenses. I just let it go as it came. I did not have time, or thought I hadn&#x2019;t, to watch my step in spending.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idzx4a5ruax">A year later I was invited to join the advertising staff of the <span class="itali">Philadelphia</span> <span class="itali">Press,</span> a big opportunity for a young man, for I got wonderful training under the management of William L. McLean, now the owner of the Philadelphia <span class="itali">Evening</span> <span class="itali">Bulletin.</span> I still retained my job as gatherer of social news&#x2014;so my income was just about the same as I had been making in Germantown.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idgwnkbaxrw">But before long my work attracted the attention of James Elverson, Sr., publisher of the old <span class="itali">Saturday</span> <span class="itali">Night</span> and <span class="itali">Golden</span> <span class="itali">Days,</span> who had just purchased the <span class="itali">Philadelphia</span> <span class="itali">Inquirer.</span> I was offered and accepted the advertising management of this newspaper.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idaxfgqbit5">This meant a big increase in my income. And soon afterward there came a happy increase in my family, the birth of a daughter. Then I was able to do what I had longed to do since the birth of my son. I got the family together again under one roof&#x2014;my wife and two babies, my mother and sister. At last I was able to relieve my mother of any cares or responsibilities, and never again did she have either as long as she lived. She died in her eighty-first year, twenty-five years after my father&#x2019;s death. I shall never forget her last words to me: &#x201C;Will, you have never caused me a moment&#x2019;s worry since you were born, and I could not have had more than you have given me had I been the Queen of England.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idqbw5hm0k9">I was making at this time four times more money than my father had made as superintendent of public schools in my home town of Phillipsburg, New Jersey.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idr80lzno8n">All the money, however, passed out of my pockets as easily as water flows through a sieve. Expenses increased with every increase in my income, which is the habit, I suppose, with most people. There was no sane reason, though, for letting my expenses go beyond my income, which I did. I found myself piling up debts, and from this time on I was never out of debt. I did not worry about my debts, though, for I thought I could pay them off at any time. It never occurred to me&#x2014;not until fully twenty-five years later&#x2014;that debt eventually would bring upon me not only great anxiety and unhappiness, but that I would lose friends and credit as well.</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="idas7bhsg7u">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="id0ncxq69n2">I am thankful that I was born poor&#x2014;that I did not come into this world burdened by the whims of wealthy parents, with a bag of gold around my neck.</p><p class="ENDEND" id="id3fkdqvhyy">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idd86151t54">But I must pat myself on the back for one thing: I was giving full rein to my big fault&#x2014;spending money as fast as I made it, often faster; but I never shirked my work. I was always trying to find more things to do, and I always found them. I spent very little time with my family. I would go home to dinner every night and romp with the babies until their bedtime, then I would return to the office and often work.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ides886ths7">So the years went by. Another daughter arrived. Presently I wanted my daughters to have a pony and cart, and I wanted my son to have a riding horse. Then I thought I needed a team to take me around with the family, driving them to a closed coup&#xE9; or an open trap. I got them all. Instead of one horse and a carry-all, or perhaps a team, which would have been sufficient for our needs and something we could have afforded, I had to have a stable, with all that goes with it. This outfit cost me nearly one fourth of my annual income.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idmtrcw9q79">Then I took up golf. This was in my forty-first year. I went at my play the same as I went at my work&#x2014;put my whole heart in it. I learned to play pretty well. My son and elder daughter played with me, and they learned to play well, too.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id0imi7o8tm">It was necessary that my younger daughter should spend the winter in the South and summers in the Adirondacks; but instead of her mother going with her alone, I felt it would be fine if the son and other daughter went along with them. This arrangement was carried out. They went to Pinehurst, North Carolina, every winter and to expensive resorts in the Adirondacks or in New Hampshire in the summer.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idkwx34m23l">All this took a great deal of money. My son and elder daughter were keen about golf and spent a lot of money on it. I also disbursed quite a little on golf courses around New York. Between the three of us we won 80 prizes, most of which are now in storage. I sat down one day and calculated what these prizes had cost me. I discovered that each trophy had cost me $250.00 or a total of $45,000.00 over a period of fifteen years, an average of $3,000.00 a year. Ridiculous, wasn&#x2019;t it?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2en5y64wf">I entertained lavishly at my home. Montclair folks thought I was a millionaire. I frequently invited groups of business men to have a day of golf at the club, and then to have dinner with me in the evening. They would have been satisfied with a plain home dinner, but, no, I must serve them an elaborate affair staged by a famous caterer. These dinners never cost less than ten dollars a plate, which did not include the money spent for music while they were dining. I had a negro quartet come to the house. Our dining-room comfortably seated twenty people, and it was filled to capacity many times.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idcyrcnilcj">It was all very lovely, and I was glad to be their host. In fact, I was very happy over it. I never stopped to think how rapidly I was piling up debts. The day came when they began to bother me a lot. I had entertained so many guests at the golf club one month, paying for luncheons, cigars, and greens fees, that my bill was four hundred and fifty dollars. This attracted the attention of the directors of the club, who were all good friends of mine and very much interested in my welfare. They made it their business to tell me that I was spending entirely too much money, and they wished for my sake that I could check my expenses.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idoihoubet0">This gave me a bit of a jolt. It made me think seriously long enough to get rid of my horses and traps&#x2014;at a big sacrifice, of course. I gave up our home and moved back to the city; but I did not leave any unpaid bills in Montclair. I borrowed the money to pay them. It was always easy for me to get all the money I wanted, despite my well known financial short-comings.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idxbrm9drx4">Here are two sidelights on my experience during my &#x201C;flaring forties.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1ex7auf9b">Besides spending money foolishly and perhaps recklessly, I loaned it with equal abandon. In cleaning out my desk at home before moving to the city I looked over a package of due bills, the total of which was over forty thousand dollars. That was money handed out to just anybody who came along. I tore them all up; but I realized that if I had that money in hand I wouldn&#x2019;t owe a dollar.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idsvxgse36x">One of the prosperous business men I had entertained many times and who in turn had entertained me, said to me: &#x201C;Billy, I&#x2019;ve got to stop going on outings with you. You spend entirely too much money for me. I can&#x2019;t keep up with you.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idrtl6g5l84">Think of that coming from a man who was making more money than I was! It should have struck home, but it didn&#x2019;t. I went on spending just the same, and foolishly thinking that I was having a good time, and with no thought of the future. This man is now one of the vice presidents of one of New York&#x2019;s greatest financial institutions, and is reported to be worth many millions of dollars.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id66715g8jh">I should have taken his advice.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idck549zt5r">In the fall of 1908, after my disastrous experience of six months in another line of business following my resignation from the Hearst organization, I resumed newspaper work as advertising manager of the <span class="itali">New</span> <span class="itali">York</span> <span class="itali">Evening</span> <span class="itali">Mail.</span> I had known Henry L. Stoddard, editor and owner, back in the Philadelphia days, when he was political correspondent for the <span class="itali">Press.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idbnexufywo">Despite the fact that I was bothered by debts, I did the best work of my life on the <span class="itali">Evening</span> <span class="itali">Mail,</span> and made more money during the five years I was associated with it than I had ever made before. Moreover, Mr. Stoddard gave me the privilege of syndicating advertising talks, which ran in his paper for one thousand consecutive publication days, and earned for me more than fifty-five thousand dollars.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id7tvm9zsb0">Mr. Stoddard was very generous in many other ways, and frequently paid me special sums of money for doing what he considered unusual things in the way of developing business. During this period, I was so deeply in debt that, in order to keep things moving as smoothly as possible, but without retrenching in the slightest way in my expenses, I borrowed money from Peter to pay Paul and from Paul to pay Peter. That item of fifty-five thousand dollars earned from syndicating advertising talks would have more than paid all my debts and left a nice nest egg besides. But all of it was spent as easily as though I hadn&#x2019;t a care in the world.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idgdymg496v">In 1915 I went on my own in the advertising business. From that time until the spring of 1922 my fees ran into very big figures. I was still making more money than I ever did, and was spending it just as fast as I made it, until finally my friends got tired of making me loans.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idv7s751b46">If I had shown the slightest inclination to curb my expenses to the extent of only ten per cent, these wonderful men would have been willing to divide fifty-fifty with me, letting me pay them five per cent of it and saving five per cent. They did not care so much about the return of the money they had loaned me, as that they wanted to see me pull myself together.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ide1z3lm4sw">The crash in my affairs came five years ago. Two friends who had stood by me loyally became impatient, and told me frankly that I needed a drastic lesson. They gave it to me all right. I was forced into bankruptcy, which nearly broke my heart. I felt that every person I knew was pointing the finger of scorn at me. This was very foolish. While there was comment, it was not at all unfriendly. It was expressive of keen regret that a man who had attained so much prestige in his profession, and had earned so much money, should have allowed himself to get into financial difficulties.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idul6igs1q2">Proud and sensitive to the core I felt the disgrace of bankruptcy so keenly that I decided to go to Florida, where I had once done a special piece of work for a client. It seemed to me to be the coming El Dorado. I figured that maybe I could make sufficient money in a few years so that I could return to New York, not only with a competency but with enough to pay all my debts in full. For a time it looked as though I would realize this ambition; but I was caught in the big real estate collapse. So here I am back in the old town where I once had big earning power and hundreds of friends and well-wishers.</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="idm7t52xihw">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="idzy80vz2t9">Fortunate is the person who has learned that the most certain way to &#x201C;get&#x201D; is to first &#x201C;give&#x201D; through some sort of useful service.</p><p class="ENDEND" id="idoec9w32ml">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ida961j4h9m">It has been a strange experience.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idh9j8jcg8a">One thing is certain: I have learned my lesson at last.

The budget allowance covering incomes within these two amounts should be about as follows:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idouoo87owt">A family consisting of two persons, whose income is $100.00 a month, should manage to set aside at least $10 or $12 a month for the savings account. The cost of shelter, or rent, should not exceed $25 or $30 a month. Food costs should average about $25 to $30. Clothing should be kept within an expenditure of $15 to $20 a month. Recreation and incidentals should be kept down to about $8 to $10 a month.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id6p42fv4km">A family whose income is $100.00 a month, should that income be increased to $125.00, ought to save at least $20 of the amount.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idwmrubg9bj">A family of two persons, whose income is $150.00 a month, should budget their funds about as follows: Savings $25. Shelter or rent $35 to $40. Food $35 to $40. Clothes, $20 to $30. Recreation $10 to $15.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idnlwl53n3v">On a salary of $200 a month the budget should be: Savings $50. Shelter or rent $40 to $50. Food $35 to $45. Clothes $30 to $35. Recreation $15 to $20.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idjrvmyjwub">A family of two, on a salary or income of $300.00 a month, should apportion the income about thus: Savings $55 to $65. Shelter or rent $45 to $60. Food $45 to $60. Clothes $35 to $45. Recreation and education $50 to $75.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id8z698zfsy">Some might argue that a family of two, making a salary of $300.00 a month, might live just as cheaply as one making but $100 or $125. However, this is not quite correct, because one who has the ability to earn $300.00 a month must as a rule associate with people who make better appearances and more entertainment necessary.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idzzq1xjvjd">A single man, earning $100.00, $150.00 or $300.00 a month, should save considerably more than a man with a family could save on the same amounts. As a rule, a single man, who has no dependents, and who is not in debt, should live on a budget of $50 a month for room and food, and not to exceed $30 a month for clothes and perhaps $10 for recreation. These amounts might be slightly increased by one who earned from $150.00 to $300.00 a month.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idty7qmu2rp">A boy who lives away from home, and whose weekly income is only $20.00 should save $5 of the amount. The remainder should cover cost of food, room and clothes.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idh152da6we">A girl, living away from home, on the same income, would require a slightly larger allowance for clothes, as women&#x2019;s wearing apparel is more costly than men&#x2019;s, and it is generally imperative that women watch, more closely than men, their personal appearance.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id7z7s3nez2">A family of three will be able to save considerably less than the amounts which can be saved by a family of two. With rare exceptions, however, such as cases where the family is involved in debt which must be absorbed out of the monthly income, any family can save at least five per cent of the gross income.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idaan099h19">It is a common practice today for families to purchase automobiles on monthly payments which involve too great an expenditure compared to their income. A man with a Ford income has no business purchasing a Studebaker car. He should curb his desires and content himself with a Ford. Many single men spend their entire incomes, and often go into debt besides, because they maintain automobiles out of keeping with their incomes. This common practice is fatal to success as far as financial independence may be considered a part of success, in thousands of instances.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idu7mzqp0jc">The instalment plan of buying has become so common, and it is so easy to purchase practically anything one desires, that the tendency to spend out of proportion to one&#x2019;s income is rapidly increasing. This tendency must be curbed by the person who has made up his mind to gain financial independence.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idmqoiwniu9">It can be done by anyone who is willing to try.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idpqfcb9k0d">Another evil, which is both an evil and a blessing, is the fact that this country is so very prosperous that money comes easily, and if not watched it goes still more easily. Since the beginning of the World War there has been a steady demand for practically everything manufactured in the United States, and this condition of prosperity has caused people to lapse into a state of careless, unjustified spending.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idebhqci4g7">There is no virtue in &#x201C;keeping up with the pace set by neighbors&#x201D; when this means sacrifice of the habit of saving a regular part of one&#x2019;s income. It is far better, in the long run, to be considered a bit behind the times than it is to go along through youth, into the days of maturity, and finally into old age, without having formed the habit of systematic saving.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idyq22qmv1n">It is better to sacrifice during the age of youthfulness, than it is to be compelled to do so during the age of maturity, as all who have not developed the habit of saving generally have to do.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idd8ig02149">There is nothing quite so humiliating, that carries such great agony and suffering, as poverty in old age, when personal services are no longer marketable, and one must turn to relatives or to charitable institutions for existence.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ideh8swxp6q">A budget system should be maintained by every person, both the married and the single, but no budget system will work out if the person trying to keep it lacks the courage to cut expenses on such items as those of entertainment and recreation. If you feel so weak in will-power that you think it necessary to &#x201C;keep up with the Smiths&#x201D; with whom you associate socially, and whose income is greater than your own, or who spend all of their income foolishly, then no budget system can be of service to you.</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="idaiesa1vhc">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="ida0rvh9k89">I am thankful for the adversities which have crossed my pathway, for they have taught me tolerance, sympathy, self-control, perseverance and some other virtues I might never have known.</p><p class="ENDEND" id="id1ejenuec8">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idmkj8q9vpq">Forming the savings habit means that, to some extent at least, you must seclude yourself from all except a well selected group of friends who enjoy you without elaborate entertaining on your part.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idvyg4l2fni">To admit that you lack the courage to trim down your expenditures so that you can save money, even if only a small amount, is the equivalent of admitting at the same time a lack of the sort of character which leads to success.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id6ltw7hh5y">It has been proved times too numerous to be mentioned, that people who have formed the habit of saving money are always given preference in positions of responsibility; therefore, the saving of money not only adds advantages in the nature of preferred employment and a larger bank account, but it also increases the actual earning capacity. Any business man will prefer to employ a person who saves money regularly, not because of the mere fact that such person saves money, but because of the characteristics possessed by such a person which make him or her more efficient.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idska0rcupa">Many firms will not employ a man or a woman who does not save money.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id3q15qhf64">It should be a common practice for all business houses to require all employees to save money.

One of his fellow workmen owned some shares in a Building and Loan Company, and had formed the habit of saving $5.00 a week, through this Association. This young man was influenced by his associate to open an account with the Building and Loan Company. At the end of three years he had saved $900.00. The printing plant for which he worked got into financial difficulty and was about to fail. He came to the rescue with his $900.00 which he had saved in small amounts, and in return was given a half interest in the business.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id6oja93pd0">By inaugurating a system of close economy he helped the business to pay off its indebtedness, and today he is drawing out of it, as his half of the profits, a little better than $25,000.00 a year.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idq1g4wmty1">This opportunity never would have come, or, if it had, he would not have been prepared to embrace it, had he not formed the habit of saving money.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idjye63tdxm">When the Ford automobile was perfected, during the early days of its existence, Henry Ford needed capital to promote the manufacture and sale of his product. He turned to a few friends who had saved up a few thousand dollars, one of whom was Senator Couzens. These friends came to his rescue, put in a few thousand dollars with him, and later drew out millions of dollars in profits.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idcdpiepc35">When Woolworth first started his Five and Ten Cent Store Plan he had no capital, but he turned to a few friends who had saved, by the closest sort of economy and great sacrifice, a few thousand dollars.

They had a good idea, and knew how to make a good cigar, but the idea would have died &#x201C;a-bornin&#x2019;&#x201D; had they not saved a little money. With their meager savings they launched the cigar, and a few years later they sold out their business to the American Tobacco Company for $8,000,000.00.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idkny8yny3y">Back of practically every great fortune one may find, as its beginning, a well developed habit of saving money.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idaejprravy">John D. Rockefeller was an ordinary bookkeeper. He conceived the idea of developing the oil business, which was then not even considered a business. He needed capital, and because he had developed the habit of saving, and had thereby proved that he could conserve the funds of other people, he had no difficulty in borrowing what money he needed.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id51lq4ve4y">It may be truthfully stated that the real basis of the Rockefeller fortune is the habit of saving money which Mr. Rockefeller developed, while working as a bookkeeper at a salary of $40.00 a month.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9nrngra9r">James J. Hill was a poor young man, working as a telegrapher, at a salary of $30.00 a month. He conceived the idea of the Great Northern Railway System, but his idea was out of proportion to his ability to finance. However, he had formed the habit of saving money, and on the meager salary of $30.00 a month had saved enough to enable him to pay his expenses on a trip to Chicago, where he interested capitalists in financing his plan. The fact that he, himself, had saved money on a small salary was considered good evidence that he would be a safe man to trust with other people&#x2019;s money.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idxrb570mkx">Most business men will not trust another man with their money unless he has demonstrated his ability to take care of his own and use it wisely. The test, while it is often embarrassing to those who have not formed the Habit of Saving, is a very practical one.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idm4oc5tj08">A young man who worked in a printing plant in the city of Chicago wanted to open a small print shop and go into business for himself. He went to a printing supply house manager and made known his wants, saying he desired credit for a printing press and some type and other small equipment.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9ot0hkuxu">The first question asked by the manager was: &#x201C;Have you saved any money of your own?&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idie5fep116">He had! Out of his salary of $30.00 a week he had saved $15.00 a week regularly for nearly four years. He got the credit he wanted.

The first question asked was: &#x201C;Have you formed the habit of saving money?&#x201D; Despite the fact that all the money I had saved was lost in the war, the mere fact that I had actually formed the savings habit was the real basis on which I got credit for upward of $30,000.00.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idzls7zegmu">There are opportunities on every corner, but they exist only for those who have ready money, or who can command money because they have formed the Habit of Saving, and developed the other characteristics which go with the formation of the savings habit known by the general term of &#x201C;character.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id5v7gz7lsx">The late J.

A few years ago a young inventor invented a household article which was unique and practical. He was handicapped, as inventors so often are, because he did not have the money to market his invention. Moreover, not having formed the savings habit he found it impossible to borrow money through banking sources.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idfkgumq6ta">His room-mate was a young machinist who had saved $200.00. He came to the inventor&#x2019;s aid with this small sum of money, and had enough of the articles manufactured to give them a start. They went out and sold, from house to house, the first supply, then came back and had another supply made up, and so on, until they had accumulated (thanks to the thrift and savings ability of the room-mate) a capital of $1,000.00. With this, plus some credit they secured, they bought the tools for manufacturing their own product.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id5p6b28n18">The young machinist sold his half interest in the business, six years later, for $250,000.00.

In some ways this is the same as being in prison, since one&#x2019;s choice of action is always limited.

First of all, I made the securing of this capital my <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">chief</span> <span class="itali">aim.</span> Second, I laid out a complete <span class="itali">plan</span> through which to transform this <span class="itali">aim</span> into reality. Backed by sufficient Self-confidence and spurred on by <span class="itali">Initiative,</span> I proceeded to put my plan into action. But, before the &#x201C;action&#x201D; stage of the plan had been reached, more than six weeks of constant, persistent study and effort and thought were embodied in it. If a plan is to be sound it must be built of carefully chosen material.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idtdqedwwhn">You will here observe the application of the principle of <span class="itali">organized</span> <span class="itali">effort,</span> through the operation of which it is possible for one to ally or associate several interests in such a way that <span class="itali">each</span> <span class="itali">of</span> <span class="itali">these</span> <span class="itali">interests</span> is greatly strengthened and each supports all the others, just as one link in a chain supports all the other links.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idvjhk423vv">I wanted this $25,000.00 in capital for the purpose of creating a school of Advertising and Salesmanship. Two things were necessary for the organization of such a school. One was the $25,000.00 capital, which I did not have, and the other was the proper course of instruction, which <span class="itali">I</span> <span class="itali">did</span> <span class="itali">have.</span> My problem was to <span class="itali">ally</span> <span class="itali">myself</span> with some group of men who needed that which I had, and who would supply the $25,000.00. This alliance had to be made through a plan that would benefit all concerned.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id25esr2tz7">After my plan had been completed, and I was satisfied that it was equitable and sound, I laid it before the owner of a well known and reputable business college which just then was finding competition quite keen and was badly in need of a plan for meeting this competition.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idl3o5r473t">My plan was presented in about these words:</p><p class="Unnum-Level-1-ListUl1" id="id9d09ux1tw">Whereas, you have one of the most reputable business colleges in the city; and,</p><p class="Unnum-Level-1-ListUl1" id="idtl2l0ftgm">Whereas, you need some plan with which to meet the stiff competition in your field; and,</p><p class="Unnum-Level-1-ListUl1" id="idiqqggfcq1">Whereas, your good reputation has provided you with all the credit you need; and,</p><p class="Unnum-Level-1-ListUl1" id="idrz5fkbnbf">Whereas, I have the plan that will help you meet this competition successfully.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idcqzbwbojq">Be it resolved, that we ally ourselves through a plan that will give you that which you need and at the same time supply me with something which I need.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idnegczlc28">Then I proceeded to unfold my plan, further, in these words:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idbt402wa58">I have written a very practical course on Advertising and Salesmanship. Having built this course out of my actual experience in training and directing salesmen and my experience in planning and directing many successful advertising campaigns, I have back of it plenty of evidence of its soundness.</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="idan4mr77bu">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="ida6vdqa9a6">The space you occupy and the authority you exercise may be measured with mathematical exactness by the service you render.</p><p class="ENDEND" id="id62xf1h89v">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ido6w6pt6i9">If you will use your credit in helping market this course I will place it in your business college, as one of the regular departments of your curriculum and take entire charge of this newly created department. No other business college in the city will be able to meet your competition, for the reason that no other college has such a course as this. The advertising that you do in marketing this course will serve, also, to stimulate the demand for your regular business course. You may charge the entire amount that you spend for this advertising, to my department, and the advertising bill will be paid out of that department, leaving you the accumulative advantage that will accrue to your other departments without cost to you.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idsuggra70w">Now, I suppose you will want to know where I profit by this transaction, and I will tell you. I want you to enter into a contract with me in which it will be agreed that when the cash receipts from my department equal the amount that you have paid out or contracted to pay out for advertising, my department and my course in Advertising and Salesmanship become my own and I may have the privilege of separating this department from your school and running it under my own name.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idkjdx9pqbj">The plan was agreeable and the contract was closed. (Please keep in mind that my <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">purpose</span> was to secure the use of $25,000.00 for which I had no security to offer.)</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idb1iikcuzx">In a little less than a year the Business College had paid out slightly more than $25,000.00 for advertising and marketing my course and the other expenses incidental to the operation of this newly organized department, while the department had collected and turned back to the College, in tuition fees, a sum equaling the amount the College had spent, and I took the department over, as a going and self-sustaining business, according to the terms of my contract.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id8ztc0vr7f">As a matter of fact this newly created department not only served to attract students for the other departments of the College, but at the same time the tuition fees collected through this new department were sufficient to place it on a self-sustaining basis before the end of the first year.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idbzreqllpw">Now you can see that while the College did not loan me one penny of actual capital, it nevertheless supplied me with credit which served exactly the same purpose.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idnmpk66k0a">I said that my plan was founded upon equity; that it contemplated a benefit to all parties concerned. The benefit accruing to me was the use of the $25,000.00, which resulted in an established and self-sustaining business by the end of the first year. The benefit accruing to the college was the students secured for its regular commercial and business course as a result of the money spent in advertising my department, all advertising having been done under the name of the College.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idqiujlyn43">Today that business college is one of the most successful schools of its kind, and it stands as a monument of sound evidence with which to demonstrate the value of <span class="itali">allied</span> <span class="itali">effort.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddmwzg91au">This incident has been related, not alone because it shows the value of <span class="itali">initiative</span> and <span class="itali">leadership,</span> but for the reason that it leads up to the subject covered by the next lesson of this Reading Course on the Law of Success, which is <span class="itali">imagination.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ided1006wrb">There are generally many plans through the operation of which a desired object may be achieved, and it often happens to be true that the obvious and usual methods employed are not the best. The usual method of procedure, in the case related, would have been that of borrowing from a bank. You can see that this method was impractical, in this case, for the reason that no collateral was available.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idinu6jn0sw">A great philosopher once said: <span class="itali">&#x201C;Initiative</span> <span class="itali">is</span> <span class="itali">the</span> <span class="itali">pass-key</span> <span class="itali">that</span> <span class="itali">opens</span> <span class="itali">the</span> <span class="itali">door</span> <span class="itali">to</span> <span class="itali">opportunity.&#x201D;</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id63pjyu6xa">I do not recall who this philosopher was, but I know that he was <span class="itali">great</span> because of the soundness of his statement.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idtwehcefi1">We will now proceed to outline the exact procedure that you must follow if you are to become a person of <span class="itali">initiative</span> and <span class="itali">leadership.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idcswignoz9"><span class="itali">First:</span> You must master the habit of <span class="itali">procrastination</span> and eliminate it from your make-up. This habit of putting off until tomorrow that which you should have done last week or last year or a score of years ago is gnawing at the very vitals of your being, and you can accomplish nothing until you throw it off.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idd3q2rnk9k">The method through which you eliminate <span class="itali">procrastination</span> is based upon a well known and scientifically tested principle of psychology which has been referred to in the two preceding lessons of this course as Auto-suggestion.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1ndulp9q3">Copy the following formula and place it conspicuously in your room where you will see it as you retire at night and as you arise in the morning:</p><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="idm2bqaug1z">Initiative and Leadership</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idgeidqkuuv">Having chosen a <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">chief</span> <span class="itali">aim</span> as my life-work I now understand it to be my duty to transform this purpose into reality.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idfbzwqevbt"><span class="itali">Therefore,</span> I will form the habit of taking some <span class="itali">definite</span> action each day that will carry me one step nearer the attainment of my <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">chief</span> <span class="itali">aim.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idb721a41ze">I know that <span class="itali">procrastination</span> is a deadly enemy of all who would become leaders in any undertaking, and I will eliminate this habit from my make-up by:</p><p class="Alpha-Level-1-ListAl1" id="idtix5hwng5"><span class="boldb">a. </span>Doing some one definite thing each day, that ought to be done, without anyone telling me to do it.</p><p class="Alpha-Level-1-ListAl1" id="idgimpz6c5e"><span class="boldb">b.</span><span class="boldb"> </span>Looking around until I find at least one thing that I can do each day, that I have not been in the habit of doing, and that will be of value to others, without expectation of pay.</p><p class="Alpha-Level-1-ListAl1" id="idj2kwtds5p"><span class="boldb">c.</span><span class="boldb"> </span>Telling at least one other person, each day, of the value of practicing this habit of doing something that ought to be done without being told to do it.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idi4qb82f9q">I can see that the muscles of the body become strong in proportion to the extent to which they are used, therefore I understand that the <span class="itali">habit</span> <span class="itali">of</span> <span class="itali">initiative</span> also becomes fixed in proportion to the extent that it is practiced.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idvig2o8dxm">I realize that the place to begin developing the <span class="itali">habit</span> <span class="itali">of</span> <span class="itali">initiative</span> is in the small, commonplace things connected with my daily work, therefore I will go at my work each day as if I were doing it solely for the purpose of developing this necessary <span class="itali">habit</span> <span class="itali">of</span> <span class="itali">initiative.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1l77x94jz">I understand that by practicing this <span class="itali">habit</span> of taking the <span class="itali">initiative</span> in connection with my daily work I will be not only developing that habit, but I will also be attracting the attention of those who will place greater value on my services as a result of this practice.</p><p class="SignatureSig" id="id86j0vrpdy"><span class="itali">Signed</span><span class="itali">.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. .&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. .&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. .&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. .&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. .&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. .&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. .&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. </span><span class="itali">.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9wlett056">Regardless of what you are now doing, every day brings you face to face with a chance to render some service, outside of the course of your regular duties, that will be of value to others. In rendering this additional service, of your own accord, you of course understand that you are not doing so with the object of receiving monetary pay. You are rendering this service because it provides you with ways and means of exercising, developing and making stronger the aggressive spirit of <span class="itali">initiative</span> which you must possess before you can ever become an outstanding figure in the affairs of your chosen field of life-work.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id0w57zchoq">Those who work for <span class="itali">money</span> alone, and who receive for their pay nothing but money, are always underpaid, no matter how much they receive. Money is necessary, but the big prizes of life cannot be measured in dollars and cents.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ideuy7t9dz8">No amount of money could possibly be made to take the place of the happiness and joy and pride that belong to the person who digs a better ditch, or builds a better chicken coop, or sweeps a cleaner floor, or cooks a better meal. Every normal person loves to create something that is better than the average. The joy of <span class="itali">creating</span> a work of art is a joy that cannot be replaced by money or any other form of material possession.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id24zof6plx">I have in my employ a young lady who opens, assorts and answers much of my personal mail. She began in my employ more than three years ago. Then her duties were to take dictation when she was asked to do so. Her salary was about the same as that which others receive for similar service. One day I dictated the following motto which I asked her to typewrite for me:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idn27o5mjmd"><span class="itali">Remember</span> <span class="itali">that</span> <span class="itali">your</span> <span class="itali">only</span> <span class="itali">limitation</span> <span class="itali">is</span> <span class="itali">the</span> <span class="itali">one</span> <span class="itali">that</span> <span class="itali">you</span> <span class="itali">set</span> <span class="itali">up</span> <span class="itali">in</span> <span class="itali">your</span> <span class="itali">own</span> <span class="itali">mind.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idwx0acbfep">As she handed the typewritten page back to me she said, &#x201C;Your motto has given me an idea that is going to be of value to both you and me.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idaijpxo6oi">I told her I was glad to have been of service to her. The incident made no particular impression on my mind, but from that day on I could see that it had made a <span class="itali">tremendous</span> impression on her mind. She began to come back to the office after supper and performed service that she was neither paid for nor expected to perform. Without anyone telling her to do it she began to bring to my desk letters that she had answered for me. She had studied my style and these letters were attended to as well as I could have done it; in some instances much better. She kept up this habit until my personal secretary resigned. When I began to look for someone to take his place, what was more natural than to turn to this young woman to fill the place. Before I had time to give her the position <span class="itali">she</span> <span class="itali">took</span> <span class="itali">it</span> <span class="itali">on</span> <span class="itali">her</span> <span class="itali">initiative.</span> My personal mail began to come to my desk with a new secretary&#x2019;s name attached, and she was that secretary. On her own time, after hours, without additional pay, she had prepared herself for the best position on my staff.</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="idkpsi4upxd">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="idukxwzrf4a">&#x201C;What helped you over the great obstacles of life?&#x201D; was asked of a highly successful man. &#x201C;The other obstacles,&#x201D; he replied.</p><p class="ENDEND" id="idjsx6y6gne">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idljz5wdo2o">But that is not all. This young lady became so noticeably efficient that she began to attract the attention of others who offered her attractive positions. I have increased her salary many times and she now receives a salary more than four times as large as the amount she received when she first went to work for me as an ordinary stenographer, and, to tell you the truth, I am helpless in the matter, because she has made herself so valuable to me that I cannot get along without her.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9x6n1yt0x"><span class="itali">That</span> <span class="itali">is</span> <span class="itali">initiative</span> transformed into practical, understandable terms. I would be remiss in my duties if I failed to direct your attention to an advantage, other than a greatly increased salary, that this young lady&#x2019;s <span class="itali">initiative</span> has brought her. It has developed in her a spirit of cheerfulness that brings her happiness which most stenographers never know. Her work is not work&#x2014;it is a great interesting game at which she is playing. Even though she arrives at the office ahead of the regular stenographers and remains there long after they have watched the clock tick off <span class="itali">five</span> <span class="itali">o&#x2019;clock</span> and <span class="itali">quitting</span> <span class="itali">time,</span> her hours are shorter by far than are those of the other workers. Hours of labor do not drag on the hands of those who are happy at their work.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iduovytvruv">This brings us to the next step in our description of the exact procedure that you must follow in developing <span class="itali">initiative</span> and <span class="itali">leadership.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9fhps5eha"><span class="itali">Second:</span> You of course understand that the only way to get <span class="itali">happiness</span> is by giving it away, to others. The same applies to the development of <span class="itali">initiative.</span> You can best develop this essential quality in yourself by making it your business to interest those around you in doing the same. It is a well known fact that a man learns best that which he endeavors to teach others. If a man embraces a certain creed or religious faith, the first thing he does is to go out and try to &#x201C;sell&#x201D; it to others. And in exact proportion to the extent to which he impresses others does he impress <span class="itali">himself.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idhbivt6vu0">In the field of salesmanship it is a well known fact that no salesman is successful in selling others until he has first made a good job of selling <span class="itali">himself.</span> Stated conversely, no salesman can do his best to sell others without sooner or later selling himself that which he is trying to sell to others.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1u8w2oc28">Any statement that a person repeats over and over again for the purpose of inducing others to believe it, he, also, will come to believe, and this holds good whether the statement is false or true.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idck7clqmnj">You can now see the advantage of making it your business to <span class="itali">talk</span> <span class="itali">initiative,</span> <span class="itali">think</span> <span class="itali">initiative,</span> <span class="itali">eat</span> <span class="itali">initiative,</span> <span class="itali">sleep</span> <span class="itali">initiative</span> and <span class="itali">practice</span> <span class="itali">initiative.</span> By so doing you are becoming a person of <span class="itali">initiative</span> and <span class="itali">leadership,</span> for it is a well known fact that people will readily, willingly and voluntarily follow the person who shows by his actions that he is a person of <span class="itali">initiative.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idch6v662uh">In the place where you work or the community in which you live you come in contact with other people. Make it your business to interest every one of them who will listen to you, in the development of <span class="itali">initiative.</span> It will not be necessary for you to give your reasons for doing this, nor will it be necessary for you to announce the fact that you are doing it. <span class="itali">Just</span> <span class="itali">go</span> <span class="itali">ahead</span> <span class="itali">and</span> <span class="itali">do</span> <span class="itali">it.</span> In your own mind you will understand, of course, that you are doing it because this practice will help you and will, at least, do those whom you influence in the same practice no harm.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idxmyafzi24">If you wish to try an experiment that will prove both interesting and profitable to you, pick out some person of your acquaintance whom you know to be a person who never does anything that he is not expected to do, and begin selling him your idea of <span class="itali">initiative.</span> Do not stop by merely discussing the subject once; keep it up every time you have a convenient opportunity. Approach the subject from a different angle each time. If you go at this experiment in a tactful and forceful manner you will soon observe a change in the person on whom you are trying the experiment.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id17d9wgvau">And, you will observe something else of more importance still: <span class="itali">You</span> <span class="itali">will</span> <span class="itali">observe</span> <span class="itali">a</span> <span class="itali">change</span> <span class="itali">in</span> <span class="itali">yourself!</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id6njlrku6o">Do not fail to try this experiment.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idzwcunft3c">You cannot talk <span class="itali">initiative</span> to others without developing a desire to practice it yourself. Through the operation of the principle of Auto-suggestion every statement that you make to others leaves its imprint on your own subconscious mind, and this holds good whether your statements are false or true.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idealpw5brm">You have often heard the saying: &#x201C;He who lives by the sword will die by the sword.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idsj2l11p6u">Properly interpreted, this simply means that we are constantly attracting to ourselves and weaving into our own characters and personalities those qualities which our influence is helping to create in others. If we help others develop the habit of <span class="itali">initiative,</span> we, in turn, develop this same habit. If we sow the seeds of hatred and envy and discouragement in others, we, in turn, develop these qualities in ourselves. This principle through which a man comes to resemble in his own nature those whom he most admires is fully brought out in Hawthorne&#x2019;s story, The Great Stone Face, a story that every parent should have his offspring read.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id5a06w8yeh">We come, now, to the next step in our description of the exact procedure that you must follow in developing <span class="itali">initiative</span> and <span class="itali">leadership.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2rzd3bf2e"><span class="itali">Third:</span> Before we go further let it be understood what is meant by the term &#x201C;Leadership,&#x201D; as it is used in connection with this Reading Course on the Law of Success. There are two brands of <span class="itali">leadership,</span> and one of them is as deadly and destructive as the other is helpful and constructive. The deadly brand, which leads not to <span class="itali">success,</span> but to <span class="itali">absolute</span> <span class="itali">failure,</span> is the brand adopted by pseudo-leaders who <span class="itali">force</span> their leadership on unwilling followers. It will not be necessary here to describe this brand or to point out the fields of endeavor in which it is practiced, with the exception of the field of war, and in this field we will mention but one notable example, that of Napoleon.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id0xhcyizyy">Napoleon was a <span class="itali">leader;</span> there can be no doubt about this, but he led his followers and himself to destruction. The details are recorded in the history of France and the French people, where you may study them if you choose.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id08uui8306">It is not Napoleon&#x2019;s brand of <span class="itali">leadership</span> that is recommended in this course, although I will admit that Napoleon possessed all the necessary fundamentals for great leadership, excepting one&#x2014;he lacked the spirit of helpfulness to others as an objective. His desire for the power that comes through leadership was based solely upon self-aggrandizement. His desire for leadership was built upon personal ambition and not upon the desire to lift the French people to a higher and nobler station in the affairs of nations.</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="id51nhhrrc1">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="id6iyq1fu76">Cherish your visions and your dreams as they are the children of your soul; the blue-prints of your ultimate achievements.</p><p class="ENDEND" id="idr5apbu3ks">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idn4mt9s4bw">The brand of <span class="itali">leadership</span> that is recommended through this course of instruction is the brand which leads to self-determination and freedom and self-development and enlightenment and justice. This is the brand that endures. For example, and as a contrast with the brand of <span class="itali">leadership</span> through which Napoleon raised himself into prominence, consider our own American commoner, Lincoln. The object of his <span class="itali">leadership</span> was to bring truth and justice and understanding to the people of the United States. Even though he died a martyr to his belief in this brand of <span class="itali">leadership,</span> his name has been engraved upon the heart of the world in terms of loving kindliness that will never bring aught but good to the world.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idtj0hg7ajc">Both Lincoln and Napoleon led armies in warfare, but the objects of their <span class="itali">leadership</span> were as different as night is different from day. If it would give you a better understanding of the principles upon which this Reading Course is based, you could easily be cited to <span class="itali">leadership</span> of today which resembles both the brand that Napoleon employed and that which Lincoln made the foundation of his life-work, but this is not essential; your own ability to look around and analyze men who take the leading parts in all lines of endeavor is sufficient to enable you to pick out the Lincoln as well as the Napoleon types. Your own judgment will help you decide which type you prefer to emulate.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idyiu7ngcvb">There can be no doubt in your mind as to the brand of <span class="itali">leadership</span> that is recommended in this Reading Course, and there should be no question in your mind as to which of the two brands described you will adopt as your brand. We make no recommendations on this subject, however, for the reason that this Reading Course has been prepared as a means of laying before its students the fundamental principles upon which power is developed, and not as a preachment on ethical conduct. We present both the constructive and the destructive possibilities of the principles outlined in this course, that you may become familiar with both, but we leave entirely to your own discretion the choice and application of these principles, believing that your own intelligence will guide you to make a wise selection.</p><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="id6x3g9xlgq">The Penalty of Leadership</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idsbjn5qz5w">In every field of human endeavor, he that is first must perpetually live in the white light of publicity.

You have already learned that when two or more persons ally themselves in any undertaking, in a spirit of harmony and understanding, each person in the alliance thereby multiplies his own powers of achievement. Nowhere is this principle more evidenced than it is in an industry or business in which there is perfect team-work between the employer and the employees. Wherever you find this team-work you find prosperity and goodwill on both sides.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idhrylcwmrd">Co-operation is said to be the most important word in the English language. It plays an important part in the affairs of the home, in the relationship of man and wife, parents and children. It plays an important part in the affairs of state. So important is this principle of Co-operation that no leader can become powerful or last long who does not understand and apply it in his <span class="itali">leadership.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idm0p3234b3">Lack of Co-operation has destroyed more business enterprises than have all other causes combined. In my twenty-five years of active business experience and observation I have witnessed the destruction of all manner of business enterprises because of dissension and lack of application of this principle of Co-operation. In the practice of law I have observed the destruction of homes and divorce cases without end as a result of the lack of Co-operation between man and wife. In the study of the histories of nations it becomes alarmingly obvious that lack of Co-operative effort has been a curse to the human race all back down the ages. Turn back the pages of these histories and study them and you will learn a lesson in Co-operation that will impress itself indelibly upon your mind.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idi48yoped9">You are paying, and your children and your children&#x2019;s children will continue to pay, for the cost of the most expensive and destructive war the world has ever known, because nations have not yet learned that a part of the world cannot suffer without damage and suffering to the whole world.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id6ipm0o7mz">This same rule applies, with telling effect, in the conduct of modern business and industry. When an industry becomes disorganized and torn asunder by strikes and other forms of disagreement, both the employers and employees suffer irreparable loss. But, the damage does not stop here; this loss becomes a burden to the public and takes on the form of higher prices and scarcity of the necessities of life.</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="idltqiva6bn">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="idvvizojnir">Service, Sacrifice and Self-Control are three words which must be well understood by the person who succeeds in doing something that is of help to the world.</p><p class="ENDEND" id="idtq6n216t4">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id0sc418kfq">The people of the United States who rent their homes are feeling the burden, at this very moment, of lack of co-operation between contractors and builders and the workers. So uncertain has the relationship between the contractors and their employees become that the contractors will not undertake a building without adding to the cost an arbitrary sum sufficient to protect them in the event of labor troubles. This additional cost increases rents and places unnecessary burdens upon the backs of millions of people. In this instance the lack of co-operation between a few men places heavy and almost unbearable burdens upon millions of people.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idp80ckfhmr">The same evil exists in the operation of our railroads. Lack of harmony and co-operation between the railroad management and the workers has made it necessary for the railroads to increase their freight and passenger rates, and this, in turn, has increased the cost of life&#x2019;s necessities to almost unbearable proportions. Here, again, lack of co-operation between a few leads to hardship for millions of people.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id5eo7nkavv">These facts are cited without effort or desire to place the responsibility for this lack of co-operation, since the object of this Reading Course is to help its students get at facts.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9ht464ppm">It may be truthfully stated that the high cost of living that everywhere manifests itself today has grown out of lack of application of the principle of co-operative <span class="itali">leadership.</span> Those who wish to decry present systems of government and industrial management may do so, but in the final analysis it becomes obvious to all except those who are not seeking the <span class="itali">truth</span> that the evils of government and of industry have grown out of lack of <span class="itali">co-operation.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idm9u0cseos">Nor can it be truthfully said that all the evils of the world are confined to the affairs of state and industry. Take a look at the churches and you will observe the damaging effects of lack of co-operation. No particular church is cited, but analyze any church or group of churches where lack of co-ordination of effort prevails and you will see evidence of disintegration that limits the service those churches could render. For example, take the average town or small city where rivalry has sprung up between the churches and notice what has happened; especially those towns in which the number of churches is far out of proportion to the population.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idihorkoukx">Through harmonized effort and through co-operation, the churches of the world could wield sufficient influence to render war an impossibility. Through this same principle of co-operative effort the churches and the leaders of business and industry could eliminate rascality and sharp practices, and all this could be brought about speedily.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idon2jagx9x">These possibilities are not mentioned in a spirit of criticism, but only as a means of illustrating the power of co-operation, and to emphasize my belief in the potential power of the churches of the world. So there will be no possibility of misinterpretation of my meaning in the reference that I have here made to the churches I will repeat that which I have so often said in person; namely, that had it not been for the influence of the churches no man would be safe in walking down the street. Men would be at each other&#x2019;s throat like wolves and civilization would still be in the pre-historic age. My complaint is not against the work that the churches have done, but the work that <span class="itali">they</span> <span class="itali">could</span> <span class="itali">have</span> <span class="itali">done</span> through <span class="itali">leadership</span> that was based upon the principle of co-ordinated, co-operative effort which would have carried civilization at least a thousand years ahead of where it is today. It is not yet too late for such leadership.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idchrdvb33o">That you may more fully grasp the fundamental principle of co-operative effort you are urged to go to the public library and read The Science of Power, by Benjamin Kidd. Out of scores of volumes by some of the soundest thinkers of the world that I have read during the past fifteen years, no single volume has given me such a full understanding of the possibilities of co-operative effort as has this book. In recommending that you read this book it is not my purpose to endorse the book in its entirety, for it offers some theories with which I am not in accord.

A. Bach, a quiet, unassuming army officer acting as an instructor. I have preserved a copy of this address because I believe it to be one of the finest lessons on <span class="itali">leadership</span> ever recorded.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2ezlrofcl">The wisdom of Major Bach&#x2019;s address is so vital to the business man aspiring to <span class="itali">leadership,</span> or to the section boss, or to the stenographer, or to the foreman of the shop, or to the president of the works, that I have preserved it as a part of this Reading Course. It is my earnest hope that through the agency of this course this remarkable dissertation on <span class="itali">leadership</span> will find its way into the hands of every employer and every worker and every ambitious person who aspires to <span class="itali">leadership</span> in any walk of life. The principles upon which the address is based are as applicable to <span class="itali">leadership</span> in business and industry and finance as they are in the successful conduct of warfare.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id8x9x2dfwp">Major Bach spoke as follows:</p><p class="Extract1Ext1" id="idns6heq80a">In a short time each of you men will control the lives of a certain number of other men. You will have in your charge loyal but untrained citizens, who look to you for instruction and guidance. Your word will be their law. Your most casual remark will be remembered. Your mannerisms will be aped. Your clothing, your carriage, your vocabulary, your manner of command will be imitated.</p><p class="Extract1Ext1" id="idfebfgoiz4">When you join your organization you will find there a willing body of men who ask from you nothing more than the qualities that will command their respect, their loyalty and their obedience.</p><p class="Extract1Ext1" id="idbclp4svhe">They are perfectly ready and eager to follow you so long as you can convince them that you have these qualities. When the time comes that they are satisfied you do not possess them you might as well kiss yourself good-bye. Your usefulness in that organization is at an end.</p><p class="Extract1Ext1" id="id4209a35hu">[How remarkably true this is in all manner of leadership.]</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idijptot9qa">From the standpoint of society, the world may be divided into leaders and followers. The professions have their leaders, the financial world has its leaders. In all this leadership it is difficult, if not impossible, to separate from the element of pure leadership that selfish element of personal gain or advantage to the individual, without which any leadership would lose its value.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idaacvzfnie">It is in military service only, where men freely sacrifice their lives for a faith, where men are willing to suffer and die for the right or the prevention of a wrong, that we can hope to realize leadership in its most exalted and disinterested sense. Therefore, when I say <span class="itali">leadership,</span> I mean <span class="itali">military</span> <span class="itali">leadership.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idjoo57o3r7">In a few days the great mass of you men will receive commissions as officers. These commissions will not make you leaders; they will merely make you officers. They will place you in a position where you can become leaders if you possess the proper attributes. But you must make good, not so much with the men over you as with the men under you.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id5iuywkq6w">Men must and will follow into battle officers who are not leaders, but the driving power behind these men is not enthusiasm but discipline. They go with doubt and trembling that prompts the unspoken question, &#x201C;What will he do next?&#x201D; Such men obey the letter of their orders but no more. Of devotion to their commander, of exalted enthusiasm which scorns personal risk, of <span class="itali">self-sacrifice</span> to insure his personal safety, they know nothing. Their legs carry them forward because their brain and their training tell them they <span class="itali">must</span> go. Their spirit does not go with them.</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="id3gnxxdf5a">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="idciiw77op5">Make excuses for the short-comings of others, if you wish, but hold yourself to a strict accountability if you would attain leadership in any undertaking.</p><p class="SeparatorSep" id="idtx6jmw189">[Separator]</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="id2osxa75pd">Great results are not achieved by cold, passive, unresponsive soldiers. They don&#x2019;t go very far and they stop as soon as they can.

All these give the officer poise. To lead, you must <span class="itali">know!</span> You may bluff all of your men some of the time, but you can&#x2019;t do it all the time. Men will not have confidence in an officer unless he knows his business, and he must know it from the ground up.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idfmoju59qu">The officer should know more about paper work than his first sergeant and company clerk put together; he should know more about messing than his mess sergeant; more about diseases of the horse than his troop farrier. He should be at least as good a shot as any man in his company.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id3joj6d8hy">If the officer does not know, and demonstrates the fact that he does not know, it is entirely human for the soldier to say to himself, &#x201C;To hell with him. He doesn&#x2019;t know as much about this as I do,&#x201D; and calmly disregard the instructions received.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id15i34zqml"><span class="itali">There</span> <span class="itali">is</span> <span class="itali">no</span> <span class="itali">substitute</span> <span class="itali">for</span> <span class="itali">accurate</span> <span class="itali">knowledge!</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id4ox41xnx5">Become so well informed that men will hunt you up to ask questions; that your brother officers will say to one another, &#x201C;Ask Smith&#x2014;he knows.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idh9vq3lmty">And not only should each officer know thoroughly the duties of his own grade, but he should study those of the two grades next above him. A two-fold benefit attaches to this. He prepares himself for duties which may fall to his lot any time during battle; he further gains a broader viewpoint which enables him to appreciate the necessity for the issuance of orders and join more intelligently in their execution.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idk4tz1th2y"><span class="itali">Not</span> <span class="itali">only</span> <span class="itali">must</span> <span class="itali">the</span> <span class="itali">officer</span> <span class="itali">know</span> <span class="itali">but</span> <span class="itali">he</span> <span class="itali">must</span> <span class="itali">be</span> <span class="itali">able</span> <span class="itali">to</span> <span class="itali">put</span> <span class="itali">what</span> <span class="itali">he</span> <span class="itali">knows</span> <span class="itali">into</span> <span class="itali">grammatical,</span> <span class="itali">interesting,</span> <span class="itali">forceful</span> <span class="itali">English.</span> <span class="itali">He</span> <span class="itali">must</span> <span class="itali">learn</span> <span class="itali">to</span> <span class="itali">stand</span> <span class="itali">on</span> <span class="itali">his</span> <span class="itali">feet</span> <span class="itali">and</span> <span class="itali">speak</span> <span class="itali">without</span> <span class="itali">embarrassment.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idqrx5wjx8p">I am told that in British training camps student-officers are required to deliver ten minute talks on any subject they choose. That is excellent practice. For to speak clearly one must think clearly, and clear, logical thinking expresses itself in definite, positive orders.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idu7whs430i">While self-confidence is the result of knowing more than your men, Moral Ascendency over them is based upon your belief that you are the better man. To gain and maintain this ascendency you must have self-control, physical vitality and endurance and moral force. You must have yourself so well in hand that, even though in battle you be scared stiff, you will never show fear. For if by so much as a hurried movement or a trembling of the hands, or a change of expression, or a hasty order hastily revoked, you indicate your mental condition it will be reflected in your men in a far greater degree.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id63sk56yqj">In garrison or camp many instances will arise to try your temper and wreck the sweetness of your disposition. If at such times you &#x201C;fly off the handle&#x201D; you have no business to be in charge of men.

He hasn&#x2019;t had time to reason this thing out. He acts intuitively.&#x201D; Forget it! Genius is merely the capacity for taking infinite pains. The man who was ready is the man who has prepared himself. He has studied beforehand the possible situations that might arise; he has made tentative plans covering such situations. When he is confronted by the emergency he is ready to meet it. He must have sufficient mental alertness to appreciate the problem that confronts him and the power of quick reasoning to determine what changes are necessary in his already formulated plan.

In a rather loud tone of voice I asked of him, &#x201C;Why do you not get that trolley line extended from the junction over to Lumberport so your friends can get in and out of town without drowning in mud?&#x201D;</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="idn4nm61u9m">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="idmb6smq1k8">Mastery of the Fifteen Laws of Success is the equivalent of an insurance policy against failure.</p><p class="Epigraph-SourceEpisrc" id="idj0iz23grg">&#x2014;Samuel Gompers</p><p class="ENDEND" id="ido5ynhxww9">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idy1qwurqwo">&#x201C;Did you see a river with high banks, at the edge of the town, as you came in?&#x201D; he asked. I replied that I had seen it. &#x201C;Well,&#x201D; he continued, &#x201C;that&#x2019;s the reason we have no street cars running into town. The cost of a bridge would be about $100,000.00, and that is more than the company owning the trolley line is willing to invest. We have been trying for ten years to get them to build a line into town.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idxqrehrj5b">&#x201C;Trying!&#x201D; I exploded. &#x201C;How hard have you tried?&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1a7s4kbjo">&#x201C;We have offered them every inducement we could afford, such as free right of way from the junction into the town, and free use of the streets, but that bridge is the stumbling block. They simply will not stand the expense. Claim they cannot afford such an expense for the small amount of revenue they would receive from the three mile extension.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idvo7fiwcdy">Then the Law of Success philosophy began to come to my rescue!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9jxr963jh">I asked Mr. Hornor if he would take a walk over to the river with me, that we might look at the spot that was causing so much inconvenience. He said he would be glad to do so.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2dz68d8yz">When we got to the river I began to take inventory of everything in sight. I observed that the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad tracks ran up and down the river banks, on both sides of the river; that the county road crossed the river on a rickety wooden bridge, both approaches to which were over several strands of rail-road track, as the railroad company had its switching yards at that point.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idpgzc57cm0">While we were standing there a freight train blocked the crossing and several teams stopped on both sides of the train, waiting for an opportunity to get through. The train kept the road blocked for about twenty-five minutes.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1c9kguo4f">With this combination of circumstances in mind it required but little imagination to see that THREE DIFFERENT PARTIES were or could be interested in the building of the bridge such as would be needed to carry the weight of a street car.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id5snw8ymed">It was obvious that the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Company would be interested in such a bridge, because that would remove the county road from their switching tracks, and save them a possible accident on the crossing, to say nothing of much loss of time and expense in cutting trains to allow teams to pass.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idlsx5nvnxh">It was also obvious that the County Commissioners would be interested in the bridge, because it would raise the county road to a better level and make it more serviceable to the public. And, of course the street railway company was interested in the bridge, but IT DID NOT WISH TO PAY THE ENTIRE COST.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idcyz3rq05n">All these facts passed through my mind as I stood there and watched the freight train being cut for the traffic to pass through.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1fxmnwqbv">A DEFINITE CHIEF AIM took place in my mind. Also, a definite plan for its attainment. The next day I got together a committee of townspeople, consisting of the mayor, councilmen and some leading citizens, and called on the Division Superintendent of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Company, at Grafton. We convinced him that it was worth one third of the cost of the bridge to get the county road off his company&#x2019;s tracks. Next we went to the County Commissioners and found them to be quite enthusiastic over the possibility of getting a new bridge by paying for only one third of it. They promised to pay their one third providing we could arrange for the other two thirds.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idmp10voxo7">We then went to the president of the Traction Company that owned the trolley line, at Fairmont, and laid before him an offer to donate all the rights of way and pay for two thirds of the cost of the bridge providing he would begin building the line into town promptly. We found him receptive, also.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iditzu0g5le">Three weeks later a contract had been signed between the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Company, the Monongahela Valley Traction Company and the County Commissioners of Harrison County, providing for the construction of the bridge, one third of its cost to be paid by each.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idky6625mvs">Two months later the right of way was being graded and the bridge was under way, and three months after that street cars were running into Lumberport on regular schedule.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idmrvq3tkiv">This incident meant much to the town of Lumberport, because it provided transportation that enabled people to get in and out of the town without undue effort.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idatb3eutbx">It also meant a great deal to me, because it served to introduce me as one who &#x201C;got things done.&#x201D; Two very definite advantages resulted from this transaction. The Chief Counsel for the Traction Company gave me a position as his assistant, and later on it was the means of an introduction which led to my appointment as the advertising manager of the LaSalle Extension University.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idfepgzi7lj">Lumberport, W. Va., was then, and still is a small town, and Chicago was a large city and located a considerable distance away, but news of Initiative and Leadership has a way of taking on wings and traveling.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idu4ve828f4">Four of the Fifteen Laws of Success were combined in the transaction described, namely: A DEFINITE CHIEF AIM, SELF-CONFIDENCE, IMAGINATION and INITIATIVE and LEADERSHIP. The Law of DOING MORE THAN PAID FOR also entered, somewhat, into the transaction, because I was not offered anything and in fact did not expect pay for what I did.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idp5e1ebiax">To be perfectly frank I appointed myself to the job of getting the bridge built more as a sort of challenge to those who said it could not be done than I did with the expectation of getting paid for it. By my attitude I rather intimated to Mr. Hornor that I could get the job done, and he was not slow to snap me up and put me to the test.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddlfz4rhkx">It may be helpful to call attention here to the part which IMAGINATION played in this transaction. For ten years the townspeople of Lumberport had been trying to get a street car line built into town. It must not be concluded that the town was without men of ability, because that would be inaccurate. In fact there were many men of ability in the town, but they had been making the mistake which is so commonly made by us all, of trying to solve their problem through one single source, whereas there were actually THREE SOURCES of solution available to them.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idiy0caneyz">$100,000.00 was too much for one company to assume, for the construction of a bridge, but when the cost was distributed between three interested parties the amount to be borne by each was more reasonable.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idphvqzjlm6">The question might be asked: &#x201C;Why did not some of the local townsmen think of this three-way solution?&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idk3t8n7vn9">In the first place they were so close to their problem that they failed to take a perspective, bird&#x2019;s-eye view of it, which would have suggested the solution. This, also, is a common mistake, and one that is always avoided by great Leaders. In the second place these townspeople had never before co-ordinated their efforts or worked as an organized group with the sole purpose in mind of finding a way to get a street car line built into town. This, also, is another common error made by men in all walks of life&#x2014;that of failure to work in unison, in a thorough spirit of co-operation.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idhf4oirzjo">I, being an outsider, had less difficulty in getting co-operative action than one of their own group might have had. Too often there is a spirit of selfishness in small communities which prompts each individual to think that his ideas should prevail. It is an important part of the Leader&#x2019;s responsibility to induce people to subordinate their own ideas and interests for the good of the whole, and this applies to matters of a civic, business, social, political, financial or industrial nature.</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="id0aekstday">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="idoy6rvfxgj">Time is the mighty hand that rocks the eternal cradle of progress and nurses struggling humanity through that period when man needs protection against his own ignorance.</p><p class="ENDEND" id="iddcgsp9ca0">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idqyaucnmbx">Success, no matter what may be one&#x2019;s conception of that term, is nearly always a question of one&#x2019;s ability to get others to subordinate their own individualities and follow a Leader. The Leader who has the Personality and the Imagination to induce his followers to accept his plans and carry them out faithfully is always an able Leader.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idrnjkj7ct6">The next lesson, on IMAGINATION, will take you still further into the art of tactful Leadership. In fact Leadership and Imagination are so closely allied and so essential for success that one cannot be successfully applied without the other. Initiative is the moving force that pushes the Leader ahead, but Imagination is the guiding spirit that tells him which way to go.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idzoawwb853">Imagination enabled the author of this course to analyze the Lumberport bridge problem, break it up into its three component parts, and assemble these parts in a practical working plan. Nearly every problem may be so broken up into parts which are more easily managed, as parts, than they are when assembled as a whole. Perhaps one of the most important advantages of Imagination is that it enables one to separate all problems into their component parts and to reassemble them in more favorable combinations.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idfksgh6g2v">It has been said that all battles in warfare are won or lost, not on the firing line, after the battle begins, but back of the lines, through the sound strategy, or the lack of it, used by the generals who plan the battles.</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="idlr1axc8yt">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="idl0e3ilkd0">Life is not a goblet to be drained; it is a measure to be filled.</p><p class="Epigraph-SourceEpisrc" id="id3qiuv2j6k">&#x2014;Hadley</p><p class="ENDEND" id="idqmfj0bbb3">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idysqjhrrcq">What is true of warfare is equally true in business, and in most other problems which confront us throughout life.

The modern dictionary defines <span class="itali">imagination</span> as follows:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1oso7kzfh">&#x201C;The act of constructive intellect in grouping the materials of knowledge or thought into new, original and rational systems; the constructive or creative faculty; embracing poetic, artistic, philosophic, scientific and ethical imagination.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idl8iucld8o">&#x201C;The picturing power of the mind; the formation of mental images, pictures, or mental representation of objects or ideas, particularly of objects of sense perception and of mathematical reasoning! also the reproduction and combination, usually with more or less irrational or abnormal modification, of the images or ideas of memory or recalled facts of experience.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idmtjaa5wdo">Imagination has been called the creative power of the soul, but this is somewhat abstract and goes more deeply into the meaning than is necessary from the viewpoint of a student of this course who wishes to use the course only as a means of attaining material or monetary advantages in life.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id6rzjv1o20">If you have mastered and thoroughly understood the preceding lessons of this Reading Course you know that the materials out of which you built your <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">chief</span> <span class="itali">aim</span> were assembled and combined in your imagination. You also know that <span class="itali">self-confidence</span> and <span class="itali">initiative</span> and <span class="itali">leadership</span> must be created in your imagination before they can become a reality, for it is in the workshop of your imagination that you will put the principle of Auto-suggestion into operation in creating these necessary qualities.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idw6z36apuo">This lesson on imagination might be called the &#x201C;hub&#x201D; of this Reading Course, because every lesson of the course leads to this lesson and makes use of the principle upon which it is based, just as all the telephone wires lead to the exchange office for their source of power. You will never have a <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">purpose</span> in life, you will never have <span class="itali">self-confidence,</span> you will never have <span class="itali">initiative</span> and <span class="itali">leadership</span> unless you first create these qualities in your <span class="itali">imagination</span> and see yourself in possession of them.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idicqnnv3g9">Just as the oak tree develops from the germ that lies in the acorn, and the bird develops from the germ that lies asleep in the egg, so will your material achievements grow out of the <span class="itali">organized</span> plans that you create in your <span class="itali">imagination.</span> First comes the thought; then organization of that thought into ideas and plans; then transformation of those plans into reality. The beginning, as you will observe, is in your <span class="itali">imagination.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idia39di866">The imagination is both interpretative and creative in nature. It can examine facts, concepts and ideas, and it can create new combinations and plans out of these.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idaz43vvogn">Through its interpretative capacity the imagination has one power not generally attributed to it; namely, the power to register vibrations and thought waves that are put into motion from outside sources, just as the radio-receiving apparatus picks up the vibrations of sound. The principle through which this interpretative capacity of the imagination functions is called telepathy; the communication of thought from one mind to another, at long or short distances, without the aid of physical or mechanical appliances, in the manner explained in the Introduction to this course.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idxx7t5uhwv">Telepathy is an important factor to a student who is preparing to make effective use of imagination, for the reason that this telepathic capacity of the imagination is constantly picking up thought waves and vibrations of every description. So-called &#x201C;snap-judgment&#x201D; and &#x201C;hunches,&#x201D; which prompt one to form an opinion or decide upon a course of action that is not in harmony with logic and reason, are usually the result of stray thought waves that have registered in the imagination.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idgoly6wf14">The recently developed radio apparatus has enabled us to understand that the elements of the ether are so sensitive and alive that all manner of sound waves are constantly flying here and there with lightning-like speed. You have only to understand the modern radio outfit to understand, also, the principle of telepathy. So well has this principle been established, through psychological research, that we have abundance of proof that two minds which are properly attuned and in harmony with each other may send and receive thought at long distances without the aid of mechanical apparatus of any sort. Rarely have two minds become so well attuned that unbroken chains of thought could be registered in this manner, but there is evidence sufficient to establish the fact that parts of organized thought have been picked up.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idhtm2nxino">That you may understand how closely interwoven are the fifteen factors upon which this Reading Course is based, consider, for example, what happens when a salesman who lacks confidence in himself, and in his goods, walks in to see a prospective buyer. Whether the prospective buyer is conscious of it or not, his imagination immediately &#x201C;senses&#x201D; that lack of confidence in the salesman&#x2019;s mind. The salesman&#x2019;s own <span class="itali">thoughts</span> are actually undermining his efforts. This will explain, from another angle, why <span class="itali">self-confidence</span> is one of the most important factors entering into the great struggle for success.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idc6oxe8ih6">The principle of telepathy and the law of attraction, through which like attracts like, explain many a failure. If the mind has a tendency to attract from the ether those thought vibrations which harmonize with the dominating thoughts of a given mind, you can easily understand why a negative mind that dwells upon failure and lacks the vitalizing force of self-confidence would not attract a positive mind that is dominated by thoughts of <span class="itali">success.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddbiam6e8m">Perhaps these explanations are somewhat abstract to the student who has not made any particular study of the functioning processes of the mind, but it seems necessary to inject them into this lesson as a means of enabling the student to understand and make practical use of the subject of this lesson. The imagination is too often regarded merely as an indefinite, untraceable, indescribable something that does nothing but create fiction. It is this popular disregard of the powers of the imagination that has made necessary these more or less abstract references to one of the most important subjects of this course. Not only is the subject of imagination an important factor in this course; but, it is one of the most interesting subjects, as you will observe when you begin to see how it affects all that you do toward the achievement of your <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">chief</span> <span class="itali">aim.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idqir85ahwj">You will see how important is the subject of <span class="itali">imagination</span> when you stop to realize that it is the only thing in the world over which you have absolute control. Others may deprive you of your material wealth and cheat you in a thousand ways, but no man can deprive you of the control and use of your <span class="itali">imagination.</span> Men may deal with you unfairly, as men often do; they may deprive you of your liberty, but <span class="itali">they</span> <span class="itali">cannot</span> take from you the privilege of using your <span class="itali">imagination</span> as you wish.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idcu6467ggu">The most inspiring poem in all literature was written by Leigh Hunt, while he was a poverty-stricken prisoner in an English prison, where he had been unjustly confined because of his advanced views on politics. This poem is entitled Abou Ben Adhem, and it is here re-printed as a reminder that one of the great things a man may do, in his own imagination, is to forgive those who have dealt unjustly with him:</p><p class="Verse1Vrs1" id="idtqhliabbf">Abou Ben Adhem (may his tribe increase)</p><p class="Verse1Vrs1" id="ido7shnp0jh">Awoke one night from a deep dream of peace,</p><p class="Verse1Vrs1" id="idvudeai7l1">And saw within the moonlight of his room,</p><p class="Verse1Vrs1" id="idgrh1d3vkm">Making it rich and like a lily in bloom,</p><p class="Verse1Vrs1" id="idkcjjkmgl6">An angel writing in a book of gold,</p><p class="Verse1Vrs1" id="idzstlxhwq7">Exceeding peace had made Ben Adhem bold,</p><p class="Verse1Vrs1" id="idlo3fgjdmq">And to the presence in the room he said:</p><p class="Verse1Vrs1" id="id4d3ec201o">&#x201C;What writest thou?&#x201D;&#x2014;the vision raised its head,</p><p class="Verse1Vrs1" id="id2tkx785us">And, with a look made of all sweet accord,</p><p class="Verse1Vrs1" id="idzmjebdbzs">Answered, &#x201C;The names of those who love the Lord.&#x201D;</p><p class="Verse1Vrs1" id="id6ckhnixzt">&#x201C;And is mine one?&#x201D; said Abou. &#x201C;Nay, not so,&#x201D;</p><p class="Verse1Vrs1" id="id51055xtr1">Replied the angel,&#x2014;Abou spoke more low,</p><p class="Verse1Vrs1" id="idcc478qv1r">But cheerily still; and said, &#x201C;I pray thee, then,</p><p class="Verse1Vrs1" id="id09myqwt14">Write me as one that loves his fellow men.&#x201D;</p><p class="Verse1Vrs1" id="id7jzsw2bp6">The angel wrote, and vanished.

Abou Ben Adhem is a poem that will never die, thanks to this man who pictured in his <span class="itali">imagination</span> the hope of an ideal that is constructive.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idsgd454dhp">The major trouble with this world today lies in our lack of understanding of the power of <span class="itali">imagination,</span> for if we understood this great power we could use it as a weapon with which to wipe out poverty and misery and injustice and persecution, and this could be done in a single generation. This is a rather broad statement, and no one understands better than the author of this course how useless such a statement would be if the principle upon which it is founded were not explained in terms of the most practical, workaday nature; therefore, let us proceed to describe what is meant.</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="idiykqh6hy2">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="idm06949v3m">The man who slanders his fellowman unwittingly uncovers the real nature of his inner self.</p><p class="ENDEND" id="id6tjicgxea">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idp2dbu7jvz">To make this description understandable we must accept as a reality the principle of telepathy, through the operation of which every thought we release is registering itself in the minds of other people. We need devote no time to proving that telepathy is a reality, for the reason that this lesson on <span class="itali">imagination</span> cannot be of the slightest value to the student who has not sufficiently informed himself to understand and accept telepathy as an established principle. We will take it for granted that you are one who accepts and understands this principle.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idy63pka3uh">You have often heard of &#x201C;mob psychology,&#x201D; which is nothing more nor less than some strong, dominating idea that has been created in the mind of one or more persons and registers itself in the minds of other persons, through the principle of telepathy. So strong is the power of mob psychology that two men fighting in the street will often start a &#x201C;free-for-all&#x201D; fight in which by-standers will engage each other in battle without even knowing what they are fighting about, or with whom they are fighting.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idxv9n2uh8d">On armistice day, 1918, we had evidence in abundance to prove the reality of the principle of telepathy, on a scale such as the world had never before witnessed. I remember, distinctly, the impression made on my mind on that eventful day. So strong was this impression that it awakened me at about 3 o&#x2019;clock in the morning, just as effectively as if someone had aroused me by physical force. As I sat up in bed I knew that something out of the ordinary had happened, and so strange and impelling was the effect of this experience that I got up, dressed myself and went out in the streets of Chicago, where I was met by thousands of others who had felt the touch of the same influence. Everyone was asking: <span class="itali">&#x201C;What</span> <span class="itali">has</span> <span class="itali">happened?&#x201D;</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id81t7rcdua">What had happened was this:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idie6dyz369">Millions of men had received instructions to cease fighting, and their combined joy set into motion a thought wave that swept the entire world and made itself felt in every normal mind that was capable of registering this thought wave. Perhaps never in the history of the world had so many millions of people <span class="itali">thought</span> <span class="itali">of</span> <span class="itali">the</span> <span class="itali">same</span> <span class="itali">thing,</span> <span class="itali">in</span> <span class="itali">the</span> <span class="itali">same</span> <span class="itali">manner,</span> <span class="itali">at</span> <span class="itali">the</span> <span class="itali">same</span> <span class="itali">time.</span> For once in the history of the world <span class="itali">everybody</span> felt something in common, and the effect of this harmonized thought was the world-wide &#x201C;mob psychology&#x201D; that we witnessed on armistice day. In connection with this statement it will be helpful if you recall what was said about the method of creating a &#x201C;Master Mind,&#x201D; through the harmony of thought of two or more persons, in the Introduction to this course.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ida90e6yl8k">We will bring the application of this principle a little nearer home by showing how it may be made to make or break the harmonious working relationship of a business or industry. You may not have satisfied yourself that it was the harmony of thought of millions of soldiers that registered in the minds of the people of the world and caused the &#x201C;mob&#x201D; psychological condition that was everywhere in evidence on armistice day, but you will need no proof that a disgruntled person always disturbs everyone with whom he comes in contact. It is a well established fact that one such person in a place of employment will disrupt the entire organization. The time is almost at hand when neither the workers nor the employers will tolerate the typical &#x201C;grouch&#x201D; inside of a place of employment, for the reason that his state of mind registers itself in the minds of those about him, resulting in distrust, suspicion and lack of harmony. The time is near at hand when the workers in a place of employment will no more tolerate one of their own rank and file who is a typical &#x201C;grouch&#x201D; than they would a poisonous snake.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idtd1mii3g3">Apply the principle in another way: Place among a group of workers one person whose personality is of the positive, optimistic type, and who makes it his business to sow the seeds of harmony around the place where he works, and his influence will reflect itself in every person who works with him.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idw132dj25q">If every business is &#x201C;the extended shadow of one man&#x201D; as Emerson stated, then it behooves that one man to reflect a shadow of confidence and good cheer and optimism and harmony, that these qualities may, in turn, reflect themselves in all who are connected with the business.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idhbvvgzpuk">In passing to the next step in our application of the power of <span class="itali">imagination</span> in the attainment of success we will cite some of the most recent and modern examples of its use in the accumulation of material wealth and the perfection of some of the leading inventions of the world.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idf8dn7vhdn">In approaching this next step it should be borne in mind that &#x201C;there is nothing new under the sun.&#x201D; Life on this earth may be likened to a great kaleidoscope before which the scenes and facts and material substances are ever shifting and changing, and all any man can do is to take these facts and substances and re-arrange them in new combinations.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id0m06klm62">The process through which this is done is called <span class="itali">imagination.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id7c0r060kj">We have stated that the <span class="itali">imagination</span> is both interpretative and creative in its nature. It can receive impressions or ideas and out of these it can form new combinations.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idelhpzc8g6">As our first illustration of the power of <span class="itali">imagination</span> in modern business achievement, we will take the case of Clarence Saunders, who organized the Piggly-Wiggly system of self-help grocery stores.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idb5rwpf5n6">Saunders was a grocery clerk in a small southern retail store. One day he was standing in a line, with a tin tray in his hands, waiting his turn to secure food in a cafeteria. He had never earned more than $20.00 a week before that time, and no one had ever noticed anything about him that indicated unusual ability, but something took place in his mind, as he stood in that line of waiting people, that put his <span class="itali">imagination</span> to work. With the aid of his <span class="itali">imagination</span> he lifted that &#x201C;self-help&#x201D; idea out of the cafeteria in which he found it (not creating anything new, merely shifting an old idea into a new use) and set it down in a grocery store. In an instant the Piggly-Wiggly chain-store grocery plan had been created and Clarence Saunders, the twenty-dollar-a-week grocery clerk, rapidly became the million-dollar chain-store groceryman of America.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idubd3pu3tt">Where, in that transaction, do you see the slightest indication of a performance that you could not duplicate?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idvw36bfkvq">Analyze this transaction and measure it by the previous lessons of this course and you will see that Clarence Saunders created a very <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">purpose.</span> He supported this purpose with sufficient <span class="itali">self-confidence</span> to cause him to take the <span class="itali">initiative</span> to transform it into reality. His <span class="itali">imagination</span> was the workshop in which these three factors, <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">purpose,</span> <span class="itali">self-confidence</span> and <span class="itali">initiative</span> were brought together and made to supply the momentum for the first step in the organization of the Piggly-Wiggly plan.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id68q8pruvy">Thus are great ideas changed into realities.</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="id233bwpk40">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="idqf5zi1az7">It will make a big difference to you whether you are a person with a message or a person with a grievance.</p><p class="ENDEND" id="id9eibh5cac">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idnw1l4k971">When Thomas A. Edison invented the incandescent electric light bulb he merely brought together two old, well known principles and associated them in a new combination. Mr. Edison and practically all others who were informed on the subject of electricity, knew that a light could be produced by heating a small wire with electricity, but the difficult problem was to do this without burning the wire in two. In his experimental research Mr. Edison tried out every conceivable sort of wire, hoping to find some substance that would withstand the tremendous heat to which it had to be subjected before a light could be produced.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idida7qdv7b">His invention was half completed, but it was of no practical value until he could find the missing link that would supply the other half. After thousands of tests and much combining of old ideas in his <span class="itali">imagination,</span> Edison finally found this missing link. In his study of physics he had learned, as all other students of this subject learn, that there can be no combustion without the presence of oxygen. He of course knew that the difficulty with his electric light apparatus was the lack of a method through which to control the heat. When it occurred to him that there could be <span class="itali">no</span> combustion where there was <span class="itali">no</span> oxygen he placed the little wire of his electric light apparatus inside of a glass globe, shut out <span class="itali">all</span> the oxygen, and lo! the mighty incandescent light was a reality.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id412ter21v">When the sun goes down tonight you step to the wall, press a button and bring it back again, a performance that would have mystified the people of a few generations ago, and yet there is no mystery back of your act.

I said nothing about his prominent parents. I said nothing about my friendship with him during former years. I said nothing about his being a deserving fellow. All these matters might have been used as sound reasons for his release, but they seemed insignificant when compared with the bigger and sounder reason that his release would be of help to 160,000 other people who would feel the influence of his correspondence school system after his release.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idt6v2tdcfm">When the governor of Ohio came to a decision I doubt not that B&#x2014;&#x2014;was of secondary importance as far as his decision was concerned.

He did not see that which I am here trying to make clear; namely, that practically all difficult tasks are easily performed if one approaches them from the right angle. There were two important factors entering B&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2019;s release. The first was the fact that he had supplied the material for a good case before I took it in charge; and the second was the fact that before I called on the governor of Ohio I so completely convinced myself that I had a right to ask for B&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2019;s release that I had no difficulty in presenting my case effectively.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idtyi6z7u08">Go back to what was stated in the beginning of this lesson, on the subject of telepathy, and apply it to this case.

W. Welshimer is the pastor of a church in Canton, Ohio, where he has been located for nearly a quarter of a century.

Reverend Welshimer has steered around this common obstacle by a unique application of the Law of Imagination. When a new member comes into his church he immediately assigns a DEFINITE task to that member&#x2014;one that suits the temperament, training and business qualifications of the individual, as nearly as possible&#x2014;and, to use the minister&#x2019;s own words, he &#x201C;keeps each member so busy pulling for the church that there is no time left for kicking or disagreeing with other members.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idyevrkbr88">Not a bad policy for application in the field of business, or in any other field. The old saying that &#x201C;idle hands are the devil&#x2019;s best tools&#x201D; is more than a mere play upon words, for it is true.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idpt82995tp">Give any man something to do that he likes to do, and keep him busy doing it, and he will not be apt to degenerate into a disorganizing force. If any member of the Sunday School misses attendance twice in succession a committee from the church calls to find out the reason for the failure to attend. There is a &#x201C;committee&#x201D; job for practically every member of the church. In this way Reverend Welshimer delegates to the members, themselves, the responsibility of rounding up the delinquents and keeping them interested in church affairs. He is an organizer of the highest type. His efforts have attracted the attention of business men throughout the country, and times too numerous to be mentioned he has been offered positions, at fancy salaries, by banks, steel plants, business houses, etc., that recognized in him a real Leader.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idkzdauq9c0">In the basement of the church Reverend Welshimer operates a first-class printing plant where he publishes, weekly, a very creditable church paper that goes to all the members. The production and distribution of this paper is another source of employment which keeps the church members out of mischief, as practically all of them take some sort of an active interest in it. The paper is devoted exclusively to the affairs of the church as a whole, and those of the individual members. It is read by each member, line by line, because there is always a chance that each member&#x2019;s name may be mentioned in the news locals.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id062v0gew3">The church has a well trained choir and an orchestra that would be a credit to some of the largest theaters. Here Reverend Welshimer serves the double purpose of supplying entertainment and at the same time keeping the more &#x201C;temperamental&#x201D; members who are artists employed so they, also, remain out of mischief, incidentally giving them a chance to do that which they like best.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idxpwkox5tb">The late Dr. Harper, who was formerly president of the University of Chicago, was one of the most efficient college presidents of his time.

Taking inventory of the wealthy men of Chicago to whom he might turn for this large sum, he decided upon two men, each of whom was a millionaire, and both were bitter enemies.</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="idymd1bc9fh">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="idq4c7yrw3z">We cannot sow thistles and reap clover.

Choosing the noon hour, when the office force and this man&#x2019;s secretary, in particular, would be apt to be out at lunch, Dr. Harper nonchalantly strolled into the office, and, finding no one on guard at the outer door, walked into the office of his intended &#x201C;victim,&#x201D; whom he surprised by his appearance unannounced.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idpchemyexp">&#x201C;My name is Harper,&#x201D; said the doctor, &#x201C;and I am president of the University of Chicago. Pardon my intrusion, but I found no one in the outer office (which was no mere accident) so I took the liberty of walking on in.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idjcehjcwhj">&#x201C;I have thought of you and your street railway system many many times. You have built up a wonderful system, and I understand that you have made lots of money for your efforts. I never think of you, however, without its occurring to me that one of these days you will be passing out into the Great Unknown, and after you are gone there will be nothing left as a monument to your name, because others will take over your money, and money has a way of losing its identity very quickly, as soon as it changes hands.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id553fw905h">&#x201C;I have often thought of offering you the opportunity to perpetuate your name by permitting you to build a new Hall out on the University grounds, and naming it after you. I would have offered you this opportunity long ago had it not been for the fact that one of the members of our Board wishes the honor to go to Mr. X&#x2014;&#x2014;(the street car head&#x2019;s enemy). Personally, however, I have always favored you and I still favor you, and if I have your permission to do so I am going to try to swing the opposition over to you.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id482ldv6lh">&#x201C;I have not come to ask for any decision today, however, as I was just passing and thought it a good time to drop in and meet you. Think the matter over and if you wish to talk to me about it again, telephone me at your leisure.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2j13ffy3p">&#x201C;Good day, sir! I am happy to have had this opportunity of meeting you.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idf7kl0gks3">With this he bowed himself out without giving the head of the street car company a chance to say either yes or no. In fact the street car man had very little chance to do any talking. Dr. Harper did the talking. That was as he planned it to be. He went into the office merely to plant the seed, believing that it would germinate and spring into life in due time.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id3t8m9exb0">His belief was not without foundation. He had hardly returned to his office at the University when the telephone rang. The street car man was on the other end of the wire. He asked for an appointment with Dr. Harper, which was granted, and the two met in Dr. Harper&#x2019;s office the next morning, and the check for a million dollars was in Dr. Harper&#x2019;s hands an hour later.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id22dc6qj3y">Despite the fact that Dr. Harper was a small, rather insignificant-looking man it was said of him that &#x201C;he had a way about him that enabled him to get everything he went after.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idto1501bvq">And as to this &#x201C;way&#x201D; that he was reputed to have had&#x2014;what was it?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idhnu6t4pwt">It was nothing more nor less than his understanding of the power of Imagination. Suppose he had gone to the office of the street car head and asked for an appointment. Sufficient time would have elapsed between the time he called and the time when he would have actually seen his man, to have enabled the latter to anticipate the reason for his call, and also to formulate a good, logical excuse for saying, &#x201C;No!&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id8facmzbb0">Suppose, again, he had opened his interview with the street car man something like this:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idcweby0rs3">&#x201C;The University is badly in need of funds and I have come to you to ask your help. You have made lots of money and you owe something to the community in which you have made it. (Which, perhaps, was true.) If you will give us a million dollars we will place your name on a new Hall that we wish to build.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddttw5arza">What might have been the result?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ideoxku0b80">In the first place, there would have been no motive suggested that was sufficiently appealing to sway the mind of the street car man. While it may have been true that he &#x201C;owed something to the community from which he had made a fortune,&#x201D; he probably would not have admitted that fact. In the second place, he would have enjoyed the position of being on the offensive instead of the defensive side of the proposal.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id4p32dfcbn">But Dr. Harper, shrewd in the use of Imagination as he was, provided for just such contingencies by the way he stated his case. First, he placed the street car man on the defensive by informing him that it was not certain that he (Dr. Harper) could get the permission of his Board to accept the money and name the Hall after the street car man. In the second place, he intensified the desire of the street car man to have his name on that building because of the thought that his enemy and competitor might get the honor if it got away from him. Moreover (and this was no accident, either), Dr. Harper had made a powerful appeal to one of the most common of all human weaknesses by showing this street car man how to perpetuate his own name.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1b9nks6b4">All of which required a practical application of the Law of Imagination.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idzzd3fs0ir">Dr. Harper was a Master Salesman. When he asked men for money he always paved the way for success by planting in the mind of the man of whom he asked it a good sound reason why the money should be given; a reason which emphasized some advantage accruing to the man as the result of the gift. Often this would take on the form of a business advantage. Again it would take on the nature of an appeal to that part of man&#x2019;s nature which prompts him to wish to perpetuate his name so it will live after him. But, always, the request for money was carried out according to a plan that had been carefully thought out, embellished and smoothed down with the use of Imagination.</p><p class="Blank-Space-BreakBsbrk" id="idqh23r8cv5">[blank]</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idw434uq0gf">While the Law of Success philosophy was in the embryonic stage, long before it had been organized into a systematic course of instruction and reduced to textbooks, the author was lecturing on this philosophy in a small town in Illinois.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id0pcc7ut9g">One of the members of the audience was a young life insurance salesman who had but recently taken up that line of work. After hearing what was said on the subject of Imagination he began to apply what he had heard to his own problem of selling life insurance. Something was said, during the lecture, about the value of allied effort, through which men may enjoy greater success by co-operative effort, through a working arrangement under which each &#x201C;boosts&#x201D; the interests of the other.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idz7b1p5cma">Taking this suggestion as his cue, the young man in question immediately formulated a plan whereby he gained the co-operation of a group of business men who were in no way connected with the insurance business.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idj2j1mpk0w">Going to the leading grocer in his town he made arrangements with that grocer to give a thousand dollar insurance policy to every customer purchasing no less than fifty dollars&#x2019; worth of groceries each month. He then made it a part of his business to inform people of this arrangement and brought in many new customers. The groceryman had a large neatly lettered card placed in his store, informing his customers of this offer of free insurance, thus helping himself by offering all his customers an inducement to do ALL their trading in the grocery line with him.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1dg76liq2">This young life insurance man then went to the leading gasoline filling station owner in the town and made arrangements with him to insure all customers who purchased all their gasoline, oil and other motor supplies from him.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idvx8b6st8w">Next he went to the leading restaurant in the town and made a similar arrangement with the owner. Incidentally, this alliance proved to be quite profitable to the restaurant man, who promptly began an advertising campaign in which he stated that his food was so pure, wholesome and good that all who ate at his place regularly would be apt to live much longer, therefore he would insure the life of each regular customer for $1,000.00.</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="idisc4y8yll">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="id0emf3j0k0">Charles Chaplin makes a million dollars a year out of a funny, shuffling walk and a pair of baggy trousers, because he does &#x201C;something different.&#x201D; Take the hint and &#x201C;individualize&#x201D; yourself with some distinctive idea.</p><p class="ENDEND" id="id9qx6lijcs">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idbo6gkrs1x">The life insurance salesman then made arrangements with a local builder and real estate man to insure the life of each person buying property from him, for an amount sufficient to pay off the balance due on the property in case the purchaser died before payments were completed.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idx4dln1nz5">The young man in question is now the General Agent for one of the largest life insurance companies in the United States, with headquarters in one of the largest cities in Ohio, and his income now averages well above $25,000.00 a year.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idt0jfuhy96">The turning-point in his life came when he discovered how he might make practical use of the Law of Imagination.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idn2tt6y9n6">There is no patent on his plan. It may be duplicated over and over again by other life insurance men who know the value of <span class="itali">imagination.</span> Just now, if I were engaged in selling life insurance, I think I should make use of this plan by allying myself with a group of automobile distributors in each of several cities, thus enabling them to sell more automobiles and at the same time providing for the sale of a large amount of life insurance, through their efforts.</p><p class="Blank-Space-BreakBsbrk" id="idf99lm67fs">[blank]</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idvwnl1foxl">Financial success is not difficult to achieve after one learns how to make practical use of creative imagination.

This will save a fortune in clerk hire, insure against theft, and cut down the overhead of store operation in many other ways.

This will force the automobile to slow down. After the lapse of one minute the gate will again rise and the car may continue on its way.

By contracting with each motorist for the season the farmer may accurately estimate the amount of produce he should provide. The advantage to the motorist, accruing under the arrangement, is that he will be sure of direct-from-the-farm produce, at less cost than he could purchase it from local dealers.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idq74wkircc">The roadside gasoline filling station owner can make effective use of <span class="itali">imagination</span> by placing a lunch stand near his filling station, and then doing some attractive advertising along the road in each direction, calling attention to his &#x201C;barbecue,&#x201D; &#x201C;home-made sandwiches&#x201D; or whatever else he may wish to specialize on.

The Master Salesman is always one who makes systematic use of <span class="itali">imagination.</span> The outstanding merchant relies upon <span class="itali">imagination</span> for the ideas which make his business excel.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ida32m1iknd"><span class="itali">Imagination</span> may be used effectively in the sale of even the smallest articles of merchandise, such as ties, shirts, hosiery, etc. Let us proceed to examine just how this may be done.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idjvfe0psx1">I walked into one of the best known haberdasheries in the city of Philadelphia, for the purpose of purchasing some shirts and ties.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idm01vjksii">As I approached the tie counter a young man stepped forward and inquired:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idnmyosynz3">&#x201C;Is there something you want?&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idzsfyxq1gh">Now if I had been the man behind the counter I would not have asked that question. He ought to have known, by the fact that I had approached the tie counter, that I wanted to look at ties.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idhj82126y9">I picked up two or three ties from the counter, examined them briefly, then laid down all but one light blue which somewhat appealed to me. Finally I laid this one down, also, and began to look through the remainder of the assortment.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idzuvbstzfl">The young man behind the counter then had a happy idea. Picking up a gaudy-looking yellow tie he wound it around his fingers to show how it would look when tied, and asked:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id672xyda6e">&#x201C;Isn&#x2019;t this a beauty?&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idmf0ko9g0t">Now I hate yellow ties, and the salesman made no particular hit with me by suggesting that a gaudy yellow tie is pretty. If I had been in that salesman&#x2019;s place I would have picked up the blue tie for which I had shown a decided preference, and I would have wound it around my fingers so as to bring out its appearance after being tied. I would have known what my customer wanted by watching the kinds of ties that he picked up and examined. Moreover, I would have known the particular tie that he liked best by the time he held it in his hands. A man will not stand by a counter and fondle a piece of merchandise which he does not like. If given the opportunity, any customer will give the alert salesman a clue as to the particular merchandise which should be stressed in an effort to make a sale.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idd38bkvt9i">I then moved over to the shirt counter. Here I was met by an elderly gentleman who asked:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idu8cgmyqbc">&#x201C;Is there something I can do for you today?&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idf7i1u34oq">Well, I thought to myself that if he ever did anything for me it would have to be today, as I might never come back to that particular store again. I told him I wanted to look at shirts, and described the style and color of shirt that I wanted.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idrrvwlio7a">The old gentleman made quite a hit with me when he replied by saying:</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="id1n8iod8mc">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="idnjd1jjavt">The man who is afraid to give credit to those who help him do a piece of creditable work is so small that Opportunity will pass by without seeing him some day.</p><p class="ENDEND" id="idbuqem8hww">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id92n0klgpz">&#x201C;I am sorry, sir, but they are not wearing that style this season, so we are not showing it.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id8emr01iyf">I said I knew &#x201C;they&#x201D; were not wearing the style for which I had asked, and for that very reason, among others, I was going to wear it providing I could find it in stock.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idc436vb7e5">If there is anything which nettles a man&#x2014;especially that type of man who knows exactly what he wants and describes it the moment he walks into the store&#x2014;it is to be told that &#x201C;they are not wearing it this season.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idsw65kf7yh">Such a statement is an insult to a man&#x2019;s intelligence, or to what he thinks is his intelligence, and in most cases it is fatal to a sale. If I were selling goods I might think what I pleased about a customer&#x2019;s taste, but I surely would not be so lacking in tact and diplomacy as to tell the customer that I thought he didn&#x2019;t know his business. Rather I would prefer to manage tactfully to show him what I believed to be more appropriate merchandise than that for which he had called, if what he wanted was not in stock.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idthh2tbgbt">One of the most famous and highly paid writers in the world has built his fame and fortune on the sole discovery that it is profitable to write about that which people already know and with which they are already in accord. The same rule might as well apply to the sale of merchandise.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id4jr2xict7">The old gentleman finally pulled down some shirt boxes and began laying out shirts which were not even similar to the shirt for which I had asked. I told him that none of these suited, and as I started to walk out he asked if I would like to look at some nice suspenders.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idfqahhl37s">Imagine it! To begin with I do not wear suspenders, and, furthermore, there was nothing about my manner or bearing to indicate that I might like to look at suspenders.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idfuqqgm293">It is proper for a salesman to try to interest a customer in wares for which he makes no inquiry, but judgment should be used and care taken to offer something which the salesman has reason to believe the customer may want.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idb8pw1trtu">I walked out of the store without having bought either shirts or ties, and feeling somewhat resentful because I had been so grossly misjudged as to my tastes for colors and styles.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id17lcjlsqe">A little further down the street I went into a small, one-man shop which had shirts and ties on display in the window.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id8km2le9dk">Here I was handled differently!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idl62gkc9b7">The man behind the counter asked no unnecessary or stereotyped questions. He took one glance at me as I entered the door, sized me up quite accurately and greeted me with a very pleasant &#x201C;Good morning, sir!&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idfnpr6ug18">He then inquired, &#x201C;Which shall I show you first, shirts or ties?&#x201D; I said I would look at the shirts first. He then glanced at the style of shirt I was wearing, asked my size, and began laying out shirts of the very type and color for which I was searching, without my saying another word. He laid out six different styles and watched to see which I would pick up first. I looked at each shirt, in turn, and laid them all back on the counter, but the salesman observed that I examined one of the shirts a little more closely than the others, and that I held it a little longer. No sooner had I laid this shirt down than the salesman picked it up and began to explain how it was made. He then went to the tie counter and came back with three very beautiful blue ties, of the very type for which I had been looking, tied each and held it in front of the shirt, calling attention to the perfect harmony between the colors of the ties and the shirt.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idgr20mmwos">Before I had been in the store five minutes I had purchased three shirts and three ties, and was on my way with the package under my arm, feeling that here was a store to which I would return when I needed more shirts and ties.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idgrukr2bl5">I learned, afterwards, that the merchant who owns the little shop where I made these purchases pays a monthly rental of $500.00 for the small store, and makes a handsome income from the sale of nothing but shirts, ties and collars. He would have to go out of business, with a fixed charge of $500.00 a month for rent, if it were not for his knowledge of human nature which enables him to make a very high percentage of sales to all who come into his store.</p><p class="Blank-Space-BreakBsbrk" id="idq9r3l1cch">[blank]</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idqa0nfl0np">I have often observed women when they were trying on hats, and have wondered why salespeople did not read the prospective buyer&#x2019;s mind by watching her manner of handling the hats.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iduz0u6qyfz">A woman goes into a store and asks to be shown some hats. The salesperson starts bringing out hats and the prospective buyer starts trying them on. If a hat suits her, even in the slightest sort of way, she will keep it on a few seconds, or a few minutes, but if she does not like it she will pull it right off her head the moment the salesperson takes her hands off the hat.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idd44lrpbw9">Finally, when the customer is shown a hat that she likes she will begin to announce that fact, in terms which no well informed salesperson will fail to understand, by arranging her hair under the hat, or pulling it down on her head to just the angle which she likes best, and by looking at the hat from the rear, with the aid of a hand-mirror. The signs of admiration are unmistakable. Finally, the customer will remove the hat from her head, and begin to look at it closely; then she may lay it aside and permit another hat to be tried on her, in which event the clever salesperson will lay aside the hat just removed, and at the opportune time she will bring it back and ask the customer to try it on again.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idwcupyu7la">By careful observation of the customer&#x2019;s likes and dislikes a clever saleswoman may often sell as many as three or four hats to the same customer, at one sitting, by merely watching what appeals to the customer and then concentrating upon the sale of that.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9j75ewoun">The same rule applies in the sale of other merchandise. The customer will, if closely observed, clearly indicate what is wanted, and, if the clue is followed, very rarely will a customer walk out without buying.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idfiotu3wfh">I believe it a conservative estimate when I say that fully seventy-five per cent of the &#x201C;walk-outs,&#x201D; as the non-purchasing customers are called, are due to lack of tactful showing of merchandise.</p><p class="Blank-Space-BreakBsbrk" id="idrqc0e72sk">[blank]</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idnsznilw8h">Last Fall I went into a hat store to purchase a felt hat.

For no good reason whatsoever the young man pulled down a brown derby and handed it to me, or rather tried to hand it to me. I thought he was trying to be funny, and refused to take the hat into my hands, saying to him, in an attempt to return his compliment and be funny in turn, &#x201C;Do you tell bed-time stories also?&#x201D; He looked at me in surprise, but didn&#x2019;t take the cue which I had offered him.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idye2qpx7jp">If I had not observed the young man more closely than he had observed me, and sized him up as an earnest but inexperienced &#x201C;extra,&#x201D; I would have been highly insulted, for it there is anything I hate it is a derby of any sort, much less a brown derby.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idzb161992g">One of the regular salesmen happened to see what was going on, walked over and snatched the brown derby out of the young man&#x2019;s hands, and, with a smile on his face intended as a sort of sop to me, said, &#x201C;What the hell are you trying to show this gentleman, anyway?&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id08smgaske">That spoiled my fun, and the salesman who had immediately recognized me as a gentleman sold me the first hat he brought out.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idswaogxs25">The customer generally feels complimented when a salesman takes the time to study the customer&#x2019;s personality and lay out merchandise suited to that personality.</p><p class="Blank-Space-BreakBsbrk" id="idvqetpdyft">[blank]</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddvaab5ghx">I went into one of the largest men&#x2019;s clothing stores in New York City, a few years ago, and asked for a suit, describing exactly what was wanted, but not mentioning price.

With embarrassment he tried to explain, but his explanations were as bad as the original offense, and I started toward the door, muttering something to myself about &#x201C;dumb-bells.&#x201D; Before I reached the door I was met by another salesman who had sensed by the way I walked and the expression on my face that I was none too well pleased.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idew63b95ni">With tact well worth remembering, this salesman engaged me in conversation while I unburdened my woes and then managed to get me to go back with him and look at the suit. Before I left the store I purchased the suit I came in to look at, and two others which I had not intended purchasing.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idvfgsfrw63">That was the difference between a salesman and one who drove customers away. Moreover, I later introduced two of my friends to this same salesman and he made sizable sales to each of them.</p><p class="Blank-Space-BreakBsbrk" id="id8vuxw5mkm">[blank]</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idu3ivbt47y">I was once walking down Michigan Boulevard, in Chicago, when my eye was attracted to a beautiful gray suit in the window of a men&#x2019;s store. I had no notion of buying the suit, but I was curious to know the price, so I opened the door, and, without entering, merely pushed my head inside and asked the first man I saw how much the suit in the window was.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idd42zwyrqi">Then followed one of the cleverest bits of sales maneuvering I have ever observed. The salesman knew he could not sell me the suit unless I came into the store, so he said, &#x201C;Will you not step inside, sir, while I find out the price of the suit?&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idnvolqzhkx">Of course he knew the price, all the time, but that was his way of disarming me of the thought that he intended trying to sell me the suit. Of course I had to be as polite as the salesman, so I said, &#x201C;Certainly,&#x201D; and walked inside.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idqweqn9urw">The salesman said, &#x201C;Step right this way, sir, and I will get the information for you.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddlls3rfvp">In less than two minutes I found myself standing in front of a case, with my coat off, getting ready to try on a coat like the one I had observed in the window.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idahpb87yep">After I was in the coat, which happened to fit almost perfectly (which was no accident, thanks to the accurate eyes of an observing salesman) my attention was called to the nice, smooth touch of the material. I rubbed my hand up and down the arm of the coat, as I had seen the salesman do while describing the material, and, sure enough, it was a very fine piece of material. By this time I had again asked the price, and when I was told that the suit was only fifty dollars I was agreeably surprised, because I had been led to believe that it might have been priced much higher. However, when I first saw the suit in the window my guess was that it was priced at about thirty-five dollars, and I doubt that I would have paid that much for it had I not fallen into the hands of a man who knew how to show the suit to best advantage. If the first coat tried on me had been about two sizes too large, or a size too small, I doubt that any sale would have been made, despite the fact that all ready-to-wear suits sold in the better stores are altered to fit the customer.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idw9q6qe5f4">I bought that suit &#x201C;on the impulse of the moment,&#x201D; as the psychologist would say, and I am not the only man who buys goods on that same sort of impulse. A single slip on the part of the salesman would have lost him the sale of that suit. If he had replied, &#x201C;Fifty dollars,&#x201D; when I asked the price I would have said, &#x201C;Thank you,&#x201D; and have gone my way without looking at the suit.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idjfcoq5qmm">Later in the season I purchased two more suits from this same salesman, and if I now lived in Chicago the chances are that I would buy still other suits from him, because he always showed me suits that were in keeping with my personality.</p><p class="Blank-Space-BreakBsbrk" id="ids11miz47m">[blank]</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id13a1kejio">The Marshall Field store, in Chicago, gets more for merchandise than does any other store of its kind in the country. Moreover, people knowingly pay more at this store, and feel better satisfied than if they bought the merchandise at another store for less money.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ida7y5g1mkk">Why is this?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idx39tokifh">Well, there are many reasons, among them the fact that anything purchased at the Field store which is not entirely satisfactory may be returned and exchanged for other merchandise, or the purchase price may be refunded, just as the customer wishes. An implied guarantee goes with every article sold in the Field store.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idxysh4uevr">Another reason why people will pay more at the Field store is the fact that the merchandise is displayed and shown to better advantage than it is at most other stores. The Field window-displays are truly works of art, no less than if they were created for the sake of art alone, and not merely to sell merchandise. The same is true of the goods displayed in the store. There is harmony and proper grouping of merchandise throughout the Field establishment, and this creates an &#x201C;atmosphere&#x201D; that is more&#x2014;much more&#x2014;than merely an imaginary one.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idgniz8iy9d">Still another reason why the Field store can get more for merchandise than most other merchants is due to the careful selection and supervision of sales-people. One would seldom find a person employed in the Field store whom one would not be willing to accept as a social equal, or as a neighbor. Not a few men have made the acquaintance of girls in the Field store who later became their wives.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idyij4xjfvi">Merchandise purchased in the Field store is packed or wrapped more artistically than is common in other stores, which is still another reason why people go out of their way and pay higher prices to trade there.</p><p class="Blank-Space-BreakBsbrk" id="ide0zgko00d">[blank]</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id45c55i74i">While we are on the subject of artistic wrapping of merchandise I wish to relate the experience of a friend of mine which will not fail to convey a very definite meaning to those engaged in the business of selling, as it shows how <span class="itali">imagination</span> may be used even in wrapping merchandise.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idmol4snmz0">This friend had a very fine silver cigarette case which he had carried for years, and of which he was very proud because it was a gift from his wife.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idr72zlov1t">Constant usage had banged the case up rather badly. It had been bent, dented, the hinges warped, etc., until he decided to take it to Caldwell the jeweler, in Philadelphia, to be repaired. He left the case and asked them to send it to his office when it was ready.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idi7s93w9xb">About two weeks later a splendid-looking new delivery wagon with the Caldwell name on it drew up in front of his office, and a nice-looking young man in a neat uniform stepped out with a package that was artistically wrapped and tied with a ribbon tape string.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddsqvzgj03">The package happened to be delivered to my friend on his birthday, and, having forgotten about leaving the cigarette case to be repaired, and observing the beauty and size of the package that was handed to him, he naturally imagined that someone had sent him a birthday present.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idnz0x720zv">His secretary and other workers in his office gathered around his desk to watch him open up his &#x201C;present.&#x201D; He cut the ribbon and removed the outer covering. Under this was a covering of tissue paper, fastened with beautiful gold seals bearing the Caldwell initials and trade-mark. This paper was removed and behold! a most beautiful plush-lined box met his eyes. The box was opened, and, after removing the tissue paper packing, there was a cigarette case which he recognized, after careful examination, as the one he had left to be repaired, but it did not look like the same case, thanks to the <span class="itali">imagination</span> of the Caldwell manager.</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="idznh6ohi3w">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="idct51nkgqs">E. M. Statler became the most successful hotel man in the world by rendering more service and better service than his guests were asked to pay for.</p><p class="ENDEND" id="ide8t755n6j">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idq02adt1j2">Every dent had been carefully straightened out. The hinges had been trued and the case had been polished and cleaned so it shone as it did when it was first purchased.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idadp6yn1m6">Simultaneously a prolonged &#x201C;Oo-o-o-o-o-o-Oh!&#x201D; of admiration came from the onlookers, including the owner of the cigarette case.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id8e0uls9sb">And the bill! Oh, it was a plenty, and yet the price charged for the repair did not seem too high. As a matter of fact everything that entered into the transaction from the packing of the case, with the fine tissue paper cover, the gold seals, the ribbon tape string, the delivery of the package by a neatly uniformed boy, from a well appointed new delivery wagon, was based upon carefully calculated psychology which laid the foundation for a high price for the repair.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idi3iq13k9q">People, generally, do not complain of high prices, providing the &#x201C;service&#x201D; or embellishment of the merchandise is such as to pave the way for high prices. What people do complain of, and rightly so, is high prices and &#x201C;sloppy&#x201D; service.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id91lmqw76y">To me there was a great lesson in this cigarette case incident, and I think there is a lesson in it for any person who makes a business of selling any sort of merchandise.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idq13h6s253">The goods you are selling may actually be worth all you are asking for them, but if you do not carefully study the subjects of advantageous display and artistic packing you may be accused of overcharging your customers.</p><p class="Blank-Space-BreakBsbrk" id="idlz2c3lu8p">[blank]</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idfxeqbfvtq">On Broad Street, in the city of Philadelphia, there is a fruit shop where those who patronize the store are met at the door by a man in uniform who opens the door for them. He does nothing else but merely open the door, but he does it with a smile (even though it be a carefully studied and rehearsed smile) which makes the customer feel welcome even before he gets inside of the store. This fruit merchant specializes on specially prepared baskets of fruit. Just outside the store is a big blackboard on which are listed the sailing dates of the various ocean liners leaving New York City. This merchant caters to people who wish baskets of fruit delivered on board departing boats on which friends are sailing. If a man&#x2019;s sweetheart, or perhaps his wife or a very dear friend, happens to be sailing on a certain date he naturally wants the basket of fruit he purchases for her to be embellished with frills and &#x201C;trimmings.&#x201D; Moreover, he is not necessarily looking for something &#x201C;cheap&#x201D; or even inexpensive.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idfgajkqmdl">All of which the fruit merchant capitalizes! He gets from $10.00 to $25.00 for a basket of fruit which one could purchase just around the corner, not more than a block away, for from $3.00 to $7.50, with the exception that the latter would not be embellished with the seventy-five cents&#x2019; worth of frills which the former contains.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id7fqeoxw3o">This merchant&#x2019;s store is a small affair, no larger than the average small fruit-stand store, but he pays a rent of at least $15,000.00 a year for the place and makes more money than half a hundred ordinary fruit stands combined, merely because he knows how to display and deliver his wares so they appeal to the vanity of the buyers. This is but another proof of the value of <span class="itali">imagination.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idzp3mi4wtn">The American people&#x2014;and this means all of them, not merely the so-called rich&#x2014;are the most extravagant spenders on earth, but they insist on &#x201C;class&#x201D; when it comes to appearances such as wrapping and delivery and other embellishments which add no real value to the merchandise they buy. The merchant who understands this, and has learned how to mix IMAGINATION with his merchandise, may reap a rich harvest in return for his knowledge.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id21rze1dyn">And a great many are doing it, too.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idkelvam0wj">The salesman who understands the psychology of proper display, wrapping and delivery of merchandise, and who knows how to show his wares to fit the whims and characteristics of his customers, can make ordinary merchandise bring fancy prices, and what is more important still, he can do so and still retain the patronage of his customers more readily than if he sold the same merchandise without the &#x201C;studied&#x201D; appeal and the artistic wrapping and delivery service.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id7nhdx5y9q">In a &#x201C;cheap&#x201D; restaurant, where coffee is served in heavy, thick cups and the silverware is tarnished or dirty, a ham sandwich is only a ham sandwich, and if the restaurant keeper gets fifteen cents for it he is doing well; but just across the street, where the coffee is served in dainty thin cups, on neatly covered tables, by neatly dressed young women, a much smaller ham sandwich will bring a quarter, to say nothing of the cost of the tip to the waitress. The only difference in the sandwiches is merely in appearances; the ham comes from the same butcher and the bread from the same baker, whether purchased from the former or the latter restaurant. The difference in price is very considerable, but the difference in the merchandise is not a difference of either quality or quantity so much as it is of &#x201C;atmosphere,&#x201D; or appearances.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2dubyk9qv">People love to buy &#x201C;appearance&#x201D; or atmosphere! which is merely a more refined way of saying that which P. T. Barnum said about &#x201C;one being born every minute.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id72yv5av7n">It is no overstatement of fact to say that a master of sales psychology could go into the average merchant&#x2019;s store, where the stock of goods was worth, let us say, $50,000.00, and at very slight additional expense make the stock bring $60,000.00 to $75,000.00. He would do nothing except coach the salespeople on the proper showing of the merchandise, after having purchased a small amount of more suitable fixtures, perhaps, and re-packed the merchandise in more suitable coverings and boxes.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ido7kswg8ny">A man&#x2019;s shirt, packed one to the box, in the right sort of a box, with a piece of ribbon and a sheet of tissue paper added for embellishment, can be made to bring a dollar or a dollar and a half more than the same shirt would bring without the more artistic packing. I know this is true, and I have proved it more times than I can recall, to convince some skeptical merchant who had not studied the effect of &#x201C;proper displays.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idcagu583d6">Conversely stated, I have proved, many times, that the finest shirt made cannot be sold for half its value if it is removed from its box and placed on a bargain counter, with inferior looking shirts, both of which examples prove that people do not know what they are buying&#x2014;that they go more by appearances than they do by actual analysis of the merchandise they purchase.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idyc6sff5vc">This is noticeably true in the purchase of automobiles. The American people want, and DEMAND, style in the appearance of automobiles. What is under the hood or in the rear axle they do not know and really do not care, as long as the car looks the part.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddqdjakyed">Henry Ford required nearly twenty years of experience to learn the truth of the statement just made, and even then, despite all of his analytical ability, he only acknowledged the truth when forced to do so by his competitors. If it were not true that people buy &#x201C;appearances&#x201D; more than they buy &#x201C;reality&#x201D; Ford never would have created his new automobile. That car is the finest sort of example of a psychologist who appeals to the tendency which people have to purchase &#x201C;appearance,&#x201D; although, of course, it must be admitted that in this particular example the real value of the car actually exists.</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="id26d563kpr">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="idg2mbxhger">Great achievement is usually born of great sacrifice, and is never the result of selfishness.</p><p class="ENDEND" id="idxzkksnqy0">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idiwyq6yt2r"><span class="itali">I gave a beggar a dime with the suggestion that he invest it in a copy of Elbert Hubbard&#x2019;s </span>Message to Garcia.</p><p class="Section-ChapterSCP" id="idia132p5hs">Lesson Six: Enthusiasm</p><p class="NumberNum" id="id7o4tsd86p">Lesson Six</p><p class="TitleTtl" id="id20bhk5kpf">Enthusiasm</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="idrxyz1qj8i">&#x201C;You Can Do It If You Believe You Can!&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idwhs5o23zm">Enthusiasm is a state of mind that inspires and arouses one to put <span class="itali">action</span> into the task at hand.

One night, while I was enthusiastically at work over my typewriter, I looked out of the window of my study, just across the square from the Metropolitan tower, in New York City, and saw what seemed to be the most peculiar reflection of the moon on the tower. It was of a silvery gray shade, such as I had never seen before. Upon closer inspection I found that the reflection was that of the early morning sun and not that of the moon. It was daylight! I had been at work all night, but I was so engrossed in my work that the night had passed as though it were but an hour. I worked at my task all that day and all the following night without stopping, except for a small amount of light food.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idkcle088ee">Two nights and one day without sleep, and with but little food, without the slightest evidence of fatigue, would not have been possible had I not kept my body energized with <span class="itali">enthusiasm</span> over the work at hand.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idysmfthou4"><span class="itali">Enthusiasm</span> is not merely a figure of speech; it is a vital force that you can harness and use with profit. Without it you would resemble an electric battery without electricity.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idrtfpr6ax4"><span class="itali">Enthusiasm</span> is the vital force with which you recharge your body and develop a dynamic personality. Some people are blessed with natural <span class="itali">enthusiasm,</span> while others must acquire it. The procedure through which it may be developed is simple. It begins by the doing of the work or rendering of the service which one likes best. If you should be so situated that you cannot conveniently engage in the work which you like best, for the time being, then you can proceed along another line very effectively by adopting a <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">chief</span> <span class="itali">aim</span> that contemplates your engaging in that particular work at some future time.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ido5hgveyr4">Lack of capital and many other circumstances over which you have no immediate control may force you to engage in work which you do not like, but no one can stop you from determining in your own mind what your <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">chief</span> <span class="itali">aim</span> in life shall be, nor can anyone stop you from planning ways and means for translating this aim into reality, nor can anyone stop you from mixing <span class="itali">enthusiasm</span> with your plans.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idwxl4mders"><span class="itali">Happiness,</span> the final object of all human effort, is a state of mind that can be maintained only through the hope of future achievement. Happiness lies always in the future and never in the past. The happy person is the one who dreams of heights of achievement that are yet unattained. The home you intend to own, the money you intend to earn and place in the bank, the trip you intend to take when you can afford it, the position in life you intend to fill when you have prepared yourself, and the preparation, itself&#x2014;these are the things that produce happiness. Likewise, these are the materials out of which your <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">chief</span> <span class="itali">aim</span> is formed; these are the things over which you may become <span class="itali">enthusiastic,</span> no matter what your present station in life may be.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idrkylr6kmy">More than twenty years ago I became enthusiastic over an idea.

When a public speaker &#x201C;senses&#x201D; the feeling that his audience is &#x201C;en rapport&#x201D; with him he merely recognizes the fact that his own <span class="itali">enthusiasm</span> has influenced the minds of his listeners until their minds are vibrating in harmony with his own.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idl40dybhe2">When the salesman &#x201C;senses&#x201D; the fact that the &#x201C;psychological&#x201D; moment for closing a sale has arrived, he merely feels the effect of his own <span class="itali">enthusiasm</span> as it influences the mind of his prospective buyer and places that mind &#x201C;en rapport&#x201D; (in harmony) with his own.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id57yg6dhz0">The subject of <span class="itali">suggestion</span> constitutes so vitally an important part of this lesson, and of this entire course, that I will now proceed to describe the three mediums through which it usually operates; namely, what you say, what you do and what you <span class="itali">think!</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idlg4ygb3fr">When you are <span class="itali">enthusiastic</span> over the goods you are selling or the services you are offering, or the speech you are delivering, your state of mind becomes obvious to all who hear you, <span class="itali">by</span> <span class="itali">the</span> <span class="itali">tone</span> <span class="itali">of</span> <span class="itali">your</span> <span class="itali">voice.</span> Whether you have ever thought of it in this way or not, it is the tone in which you make a statement, more than it is the statement itself, that carries conviction or fails to convince. No mere combination of words can ever take the place of a deep belief in a statement that is expressed with burning <span class="itali">enthusiasm.</span> Words are but devitalized sounds unless colored with feeling that is born of <span class="itali">enthusiasm.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id12ocme92b">Here the printed word fails me, for I can never express with mere type and paper the difference between words that fall from unemotional lips, without the fire of <span class="itali">enthusiasm</span> back of them, and those which seem to pour forth from a heart that is bursting with eagerness for expression. The difference is there, however.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id6gbtg7r36">Thus, <span class="itali">what</span> <span class="itali">you</span> <span class="itali">say,</span> and the way in which you say it, conveys a meaning that may be just the opposite to what is intended. This accounts for many a failure by the salesman who presents his arguments in words which seem logical enough, but lack the coloring that can come only from <span class="itali">enthusiasm</span> that is born of sincerity and belief in the goods he is trying to sell. His words said one thing, but the tone of his voice <span class="itali">suggested</span> something entirely different; therefore, no sale was made.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idu3905o3t5">That which you <span class="itali">say</span> is an important factor in the operation of the principle of <span class="itali">suggestion,</span> but not nearly so important as that which you <span class="itali">do.</span> <span class="itali">Your</span> <span class="itali">acts</span> <span class="itali">will</span> <span class="itali">count</span> <span class="itali">for</span> <span class="itali">more</span> <span class="itali">than</span> <span class="itali">your</span> <span class="itali">words,</span> and woe unto you if the two fail to harmonize.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idgwhglpu7h">If a man preach the Golden Rule as a sound rule of conduct his words will fall upon deaf ears if he does not practice that which he preaches. The most effective sermon that any man can preach on the soundness of the Golden Rule is that which he preaches, by <span class="itali">suggestion,</span> when he applies this rule in his relationships with his fellow men.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idzrrwnhefz">If a salesman of Ford automobiles drives up to his prospective purchaser in a Buick, or some other make of car, all the arguments he can present on behalf of the Ford will be without effect. Once I went into one of the offices of the Dictaphone Company to look at a dictaphone (dictating machine). The salesman in charge presented a logical argument as to the machine&#x2019;s merits, while the stenographer at his side was transcribing letters from a shorthand note-book. His arguments in favor of a dictating machine, as compared with the old method of dictating to a stenographer, did not impress me, because his actions were not in harmony with his words.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9fxjjntia">Your <span class="itali">thoughts</span> constitute the most important of the three ways in which you apply the principle of <span class="itali">suggestion,</span> for the reason that they control the tone of your words and, to some extent at least, your actions. If your <span class="itali">thoughts</span> and your <span class="itali">actions</span> and your <span class="itali">words</span> harmonize, you are bound to influence those with whom you come in contact, more or less toward your way of thinking.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idjth6k2mo6">We will now proceed to analyze the subject of <span class="itali">suggestion</span> and to show you exactly how to apply the principle upon which it operates. As we have already seen, <span class="itali">suggestion</span> differs from <span class="itali">Auto-suggestion</span> only in one way&#x2014;we use it, consciously or unconsciously, when we influence others, while we use <span class="itali">Auto-suggestion</span> as a means of influencing ourselves.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id88e5uy6nf">Before you can influence another person through <span class="itali">suggestion,</span> that person&#x2019;s mind must be in a state of neutrality; that is, it must be open and receptive to your method of <span class="itali">suggestion.</span> Right here is where most salesmen fail&#x2014;they try to make a sale before the mind of the prospective buyer has been rendered receptive or neutralized. This is such a vital point in this lesson that I feel impelled to dwell upon it until there can be no doubt that you understand the principle that I am describing.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idqagy36931">When I say that the salesman must neutralize the mind of his prospective purchaser before a sale can be made I mean that the prospective purchaser&#x2019;s mind must be credulous. A state of confidence must have been established and it is obvious that there can be no set rule for either establishing confidence or neutralizing the mind to a state of openness. Here the ingenuity of the salesman must supply that which cannot be set down as a hard and fast rule.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2kragtxl5">I know a life insurance salesman who sells nothing but large policies, amounting to $100,000.00 and upward. Before this man even approaches the subject of insurance with a prospective client he familiarizes himself with the prospective client&#x2019;s complete history, including his education, his financial status, his eccentricities if he has any, his religious preferences and other data too numerous to be listed. Armed with this information, he manages to secure an introduction under conditions which permit him to know the prospective client in a social as well as a business way. Nothing is said about the sale of life insurance during his first visit, nor his second, and sometimes he does not approach the subject of insurance until he has become very well acquainted with the prospective client.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id7khwltls3">All this time, however, he is not dissipating his efforts. He is taking advantage of these friendly visits for the purpose of neutralizing his prospective client&#x2019;s mind; that is, he is building up a relationship of confidence so that when the time comes for him to talk life insurance that which he says will fall upon ears that <span class="itali">willingly</span> <span class="itali">listen.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idiv4oz9knu">Some years ago I wrote a book entitled How to Sell Your Services. Just before the manuscript went to the publisher, it occurred to me to request some of the well known men of the United States to write letters of endorsement to be published in the book. The printer was then waiting for the manuscript; therefore, I hurriedly wrote a letter to some eight or ten men, in which I briefly outlined exactly what I wanted, but the letter brought back no replies. I had failed to observe two important prerequisites for success&#x2014;I had written the letter so hurriedly that I had failed to inject the spirit of <span class="itali">enthusiasm</span> into it, and I had neglected so to word the letter that it had the effect of neutralizing the minds of those to whom it was sent; therefore, I had not paved the way for the application of the principle of <span class="itali">suggestion.</span></p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="idt6zrdc93z">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="idmiypnx6gb">A careful inventory of all your past experiences may disclose the startling fact that everything has happened for the best.</p><p class="ENDEND" id="id6y7rx4thw">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2rrgj11gx">After I discovered my mistake, I then wrote a letter that was based upon strict application of the principle of <span class="itali">suggestion,</span> and this letter not only brought back replies from all to whom it was sent, but many of the replies were masterpieces and served, far beyond my fondest hopes, as valuable supplements to the book. For the purpose of comparison, to show you how the principle of <span class="itali">suggestion</span> may be used in writing a letter, and what an important part <span class="itali">enthusiasm</span> plays in giving the written word &#x201C;flesh,&#x201D; the two letters are here reproduced. It will not be necessary to indicate which letter failed, as that will be quite obvious:</p><p class="LETTER-ALTR-A" id="id3mlfoc6gt">LETTER-A</p><p class="SalutationSal" id="id01kz3rblw">My dear Mr. Ford:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idu0s9mw4ja">I am just completing a manuscript for a new book entitled How to Sell Your Services. I anticipate the sale of several hundred thousand of these books and I believe those who purchase the book would welcome the opportunity of receiving a message from you as to the best method of marketing personal services.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id5pdajyvry">Would you, therefore, be good enough to give me a few minutes of your time by writing a brief message to be published in my book? This will be a big favor to me personally and I know it would be appreciated by the readers of the book.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idvucbdrjo9">Thanking you in advance for any consideration you may care to show me, I am,</p><p class="ClosingClos" id="idu6pd0e8f2">Yours very truly,</p><p class="SeparatorSep" id="idlmz8hf4v2">[Separator]</p><p class="AddressAdd" id="idgboek8r9u">Hon. Thomas R. Marshall,</p><p class="AddressAdd" id="id9m4mv50hl">Vice-President of the United States,</p><p class="AddressAdd" id="idg2dr7qaef">Washington, D. C.</p><p class="SalutationSal" id="idzjkp9gmlu">My dear Mr. Marshall:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idoud0p4qve">Would you care for the opportunity to send a message of encouragement, and possibly a word of advice, to a few hundred thousand of your fellow men who have failed to make their mark in the world as successfully as you have done?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id78cj9i1lv">I have about completed a manuscript for a book to be entitled How to Sell Your Services. The main point made in the book is that service rendered is cause and the pay envelope is effect; and that the latter varies in proportion to the efficiency of the former.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idonk47c1en">The book would be incomplete without a few words of advice from a few men who, like yourself, have come up from the bottom to enviable positions in the world. Therefore, if you will write me of your views as to the most essential points to be borne in mind by those who are offering personal services for sale I will pass your message on through my book, which will insure its getting into hands where it will do a world of good for a class of earnest people who are struggling to find their places in the world&#x2019;s work.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idsjvr723uu">I know you are a busy man, Mr. Marshall, but please bear in mind that by simply calling in your secretary and dictating a brief letter you will be sending forth an important message to possibly half a million people. In money this will not be worth to you the two cent stamp that you will place on the letter, but, if estimated from the viewpoint of the good it may do others who are less fortunate than yourself, it may be worth the difference between success and failure to many a worthy person who will read your message, believe in it, and be guided by it.</p><p class="ClosingClos" id="idl2a7an5oi">Very cordially yours,</p><p class="ENDEND" id="idovzrw1q7s">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idm4rh5do0z">Now, let us analyze the two letters and find out why one failed in its mission while the other succeeded. This analysis should start with one of the most important fundamentals of salesmanship, namely motive. In the first letter it is obvious that the motive is entirely one of self-interest. The letter states exactly what is wanted, but the wording of it leaves a doubt as to <span class="itali">why</span> the request is made or whom it is intended to benefit. Study the sentence in the second paragraph, &#x201C;This will be a big favor to me personally, etc.&#x201D; Now it may seem to be a peculiar trait, but the truth is that most people will not grant favors just to please others. If I ask you to render a service that will benefit me, without bringing you some corresponding advantage, you will not show much enthusiasm in granting that favor; you may refuse altogether if you have a plausible excuse for refusing. But if I ask you to render a service that will benefit a third person, even though the service must be rendered through me; and if that service is of such a nature that it is likely to reflect credit on you, the chances are that you will render the service willingly.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id6y2r3e29a">We see this psychology demonstrated by the man who pitches a dime to the beggar on the street, or perhaps refuses even the dime, but willingly hands over a hundred or a thousand dollars to the charity worker who is begging in the name of others.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2wmbtrmuq">But the most damaging suggestion of all is contained in the last and most important paragraph of the letter, &#x201C;Thanking you in advance for <span class="itali">any</span> <span class="itali">consideration</span> <span class="itali">you</span> <span class="itali">may</span> <span class="itali">care</span> <span class="itali">to</span> <span class="itali">show</span> <span class="itali">me.&#x201D;</span> This sentence strongly suggests that the writer of the letter anticipates a refusal of his request. It clearly indicates lack of <span class="itali">enthusiasm.</span> It paves the way for a refusal of the request. There is not one single word in the entire letter that places in the mind of a man to whom it is sent a satisfactory reason why he should comply with the request. On the other hand, he can clearly see that the object of the letter is to secure from him a letter of endorsement that will help sell the book. The most important selling argument&#x2014;in fact, the only selling argument available in connection with this request, has been lost because it was not brought out and established as the real motive for making the request. This argument was but faintly mentioned in the sentence, &#x201C;I believe those who purchase the book would welcome the opportunity of receiving a message from you as to the best method of marketing personal services.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id583ypoce0">The opening paragraph of the letter violates an important fundamental of salesmanship because it clearly suggests that the object of the letter is to gain some advantage for its writer, and does not even hint at any corresponding advantage that may accrue to the person to whom it is sent. Instead of neutralizing the mind of the recipient of the letter, as it should do, it has just the opposite effect; it causes him to close his mind against all argument that follows; it puts him in a frame of mind that makes it easy for him to say no. It reminds me of a salesman&#x2014;or, perhaps I should say, a man who wanted to be a salesman&#x2014;who once approached me for the purpose of selling me a subscription to the <span class="itali">Saturday</span> <span class="itali">Evening</span> <span class="itali">Post.</span> As he held a copy of the magazine in front of me he suggested the answer I should make by this question:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id4irmwlc9a"><span class="itali">&#x201C;You</span> <span class="itali">wouldn&#x2019;t</span> <span class="itali">subscribe</span> <span class="itali">for</span> <span class="itali">the</span> <span class="itali">Post</span> <span class="itali">to</span> <span class="itali">help</span> <span class="itali">me</span> <span class="itali">out,</span> <span class="itali">would</span> <span class="itali">you?&#x201D;</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idmyc9ls7jq">Of course I said no! He had made it easy for me to say no. There was no <span class="itali">enthusiasm</span> back of his words, and gloom and discouragement were written all over his face. He needed the commission he would have made on my subscription had I purchased; no doubt about that&#x2014;but he suggested nothing that appealed to my self-interest motive, therefore he lost a sale. But the loss of this <span class="itali">one</span> <span class="itali">sale</span> was not the sad part of his misfortune; the sad part was that this same attitude was causing him to lose all other sales which he might have made had he changed his approach.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idexhj2i5uo">A few weeks later another subscription agent approached me. She was selling a combination of six magazines, one of which was the <span class="itali">Saturday</span> <span class="itali">Evening</span> <span class="itali">Post,</span> but how different was her approach. She glanced at my library table, on which she saw several magazines, then at my book shelves, and exclaimed with <span class="itali">enthusiasm:</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idxhct9sm5r"><span class="itali">&#x201C;Oh!</span> <span class="itali">I</span> <span class="itali">see</span> <span class="itali">you</span> <span class="itali">are</span> <span class="itali">a</span> <span class="itali">lover</span> <span class="itali">of</span> <span class="itali">books</span> <span class="itali">and</span> <span class="itali">magazines.&#x201D;</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id29kfozdis">I <span class="itali">proudly</span> pleaded guilty to the charge. Observe the word <span class="itali">&#x201C;proudly,&#x201D;</span> for it has an important bearing on this incident. I laid down the manuscript that I was reading when this saleswoman came in, for I could see that she was a woman of intelligence. Just how I came to see this I will leave to your imagination. The important point is that I laid down the manuscript and actually felt myself wanting to hear what she had to say.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idnlbo03rla">With the aid of eleven words, plus a pleasant smile, plus a tone of genuine <span class="itali">enthusiasm,</span> she had neutralized my mind sufficiently to make me want to hear her. She had performed her most difficult task, with those few words, because I had made up my mind when she was announced that I would keep my manuscript in my hands and thereby convey to her mind, as politely as I could, the fact that I was busy and did not wish to be detained.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idzzi5ep82h">Being a student of salesmanship and of <span class="itali">suggestion,</span> I carefully watched to see what her next move would be. She had a bundle of magazines under her arm and I expected she would unroll it and begin to urge me to purchase, but she didn&#x2019;t. You will recall that I said she was <span class="itali">selling</span> a combination of six magazines; not merely trying to sell them.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idspu8wb8m5">She walked over to my book shelves, pulled out a copy of Emerson&#x2019;s <span class="itali">Essays,</span> and for the next ten minutes she talked about Emerson&#x2019;s essay on Compensation so interestingly that I lost sight of the roll of magazines that she carried. (She was neutralizing my mind some more.)</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="iduqsgl0sgr">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="idmgtvdhz6k">First impressions really do count. Dress to look the part you intend to play in life, but take care not to overdo it.</p><p class="ENDEND" id="idjaw5zk5v6">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id5v0hsfvid">Incidentally, she gave me a sufficient number of new ideas about Emerson&#x2019;s works to provide material for an excellent editorial.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idoa7guyjzs">Then she asked me which magazines I received regularly, and after I told her she smiled as she began to unroll her bundle of magazines and laid them on the table in front of me. She analyzed her magazines one by one, and explained just why I should have each of them. The <span class="itali">Saturday</span> <span class="itali">Evening</span> <span class="itali">Post</span> would bring me the cleanest fiction; <span class="itali">Literary</span> <span class="itali">Digest</span> would bring me the news of the world in condensed form, such as a <span class="itali">busy</span> <span class="itali">man</span> <span class="itali">like</span> <span class="itali">myself</span> would demand; the <span class="itali">American</span> <span class="itali">Magazine</span> would bring me the latest biographies of the men who were leading in business and industry, and so on, until she had covered the entire list.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idzijyzu4jp">But I was not responding to her argument as freely as she thought I should have, so she slipped me this gentle <span class="itali">suggestion:</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idunm7gs601"><span class="itali">&#x201C;A</span> <span class="itali">man</span> <span class="itali">of</span> <span class="itali">your</span> <span class="itali">position</span> <span class="itali">is</span> <span class="itali">bound</span> <span class="itali">to</span> <span class="itali">be</span> <span class="itali">well</span> <span class="itali">informed</span> <span class="itali">and,</span> <span class="itali">if</span> <span class="itali">he</span> <span class="itali">isn&#x2019;t,</span> <span class="itali">it</span> <span class="itali">will</span> <span class="itali">show</span> <span class="itali">up</span> <span class="itali">in</span> <span class="itali">his</span> <span class="itali">own</span> <span class="itali">work!&#x201D;</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idxorm48j9f">She spoke the truth! Her remark was both a compliment and a gentle reprimand. She made me feel somewhat sheepish because she had taken inventory of my reading matter&#x2014;and six of the leading magazines were not on my list. (The six that she was selling.)</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idpnw1zyj93">Then I began to &#x201C;slip&#x201D; by asking her how much the six magazines would cost. She put on the finishing touches of a well presented sales talk by this tactful reply: &#x201C;The cost? Why, the cost of the entire number is less than you receive for a single page of the typewritten manuscript that you had in your hands when I came in.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id7cccs68my">Again she spoke the truth. And how did she happen to guess so well what I was getting for my manuscript? The answer is, she didn&#x2019;t guess&#x2014;<span class="itali">she</span> <span class="itali">knew!</span> She made it a part of her business to draw me out tactfully as to the nature of my work (which in no way made me angry). She became so deeply interested in the manuscript which I had laid down when she came in, that she actually induced me to talk about it. (I am not saying, of course, that this required any great amount of skill or coaxing, for have I not said that <span class="itali">it</span> <span class="itali">was</span> <span class="itali">my</span> <span class="itali">manuscript?</span>) In my remarks about that manuscript I suspect I <span class="itali">admitted</span> that I was receiving $250.00 for the fifteen pages; yes, <span class="itali">I</span> <span class="itali">am</span> <span class="itali">sure</span> <span class="itali">I</span> <span class="itali">was</span> <span class="itali">careless</span> <span class="itali">enough</span> <span class="itali">to</span> <span class="itali">admit</span> <span class="itali">that</span> <span class="itali">I</span> <span class="itali">was</span> <span class="itali">being</span> <span class="itali">well</span> <span class="itali">paid</span> <span class="itali">for</span> <span class="itali">my</span> <span class="itali">work.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idgxiqfy3fe">Perhaps she induced me to make the admission. At any rate, the information was valuable to her and she made effective use of it at the psychological moment. For all I know it was a part of her plan to observe carefully all that she saw and heard, with the object of finding out just what my weaknesses were and what I was most interested in discussing. Some salesmen take the time to do this; some do not.

She was one of them; and the other one was the fact that she managed to get me to talk <span class="itali">about</span> <span class="itali">my</span> <span class="itali">own</span> <span class="itali">work!</span> Of course I am not suggesting that <span class="itali">you</span> should be meddlesome enough to smile at my carelessness as you read this; or that you should gather from this incident the impression that this tactful saleswoman actually led me to talk of my own work for the purpose of neutralizing my mind so that I would listen to her, when she was ready to talk of her magazines, as patiently as she had listened to me. However, if you should be clever enough to draw a lesson from her method, there is no way for me to stop you from doing so.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id89fp7lm0c">As I have stated, when I talked I mixed <span class="itali">enthusiasm</span> with my conversation. Perhaps I caught the spirit of <span class="itali">enthusiasm</span> from this clever saleswoman, when she made that opening remark as she came into my study. Yes, I am sure this is where I caught it, and, I am just as sure that her enthusiasm was not a matter of accident. She had trained herself to look for something in her prospective purchaser&#x2019;s office, or his work, or his conversation, over which she could express <span class="itali">enthusiasm.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idfjer4uzjb">Remember, <span class="itali">suggestion</span> and <span class="itali">enthusiasm</span> go hand in hand!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idjq8ani463">I can remember, as though it were yesterday, the feeling that came over me when that would-be salesman pushed that <span class="itali">Saturday</span> <span class="itali">Evening</span> <span class="itali">Post</span> in front of me, as he remarked:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9uysfu8iz">&#x201C;You wouldn&#x2019;t subscribe for the <span class="itali">Post</span> to help me out, would you?&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idaol61nb8o">His words were chilled, they were lifeless; they lacked <span class="itali">enthusiasm;</span> they registered an impression in my mind, but that impression was one of coldness. I wanted to see the man go out at the door at which he had come in. Mind you, I am not naturally unsympathetic, but the tone of his voice, the look on his face, his general bearing <span class="itali">suggested</span> that he was there to ask a favor and not to offer one.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idnjmgyx9eo"><span class="itali">Suggestion</span> is one of the most subtle and powerful principles of psychology. You are making use of it in all that you do and say and think, but, unless you understand the difference between negative suggestion and positive suggestion, you may be using it in such a way that it is bringing you defeat instead of success.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id8ltogi6od">Science has established the fact that through the negative use of suggestion life may be extinguished. Some years ago, in France, a criminal was condemned to death, but before the time for his execution an experiment was performed on him which conclusively proved that through the principle of <span class="itali">suggestion</span> death could be produced. The criminal was brought to the guillotine and his head was placed under the knife, after he had been blindfolded. A heavy, sharp edged plank was then dropped on his neck, producing a shock similar to that of a sharp edged knife. Warm water was then gently poured on his neck and allowed to trickle slowly down his spine, to imitate the flow of warm blood. In seven minutes the doctors pronounced the man dead. His imagination, through the principle of suggestion, had actually turned the sharp edged plank into a guillotine blade and stopped his heart from beating.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idiksqt9qnf">In the little town where I was raised, there lived an old lady who constantly complained that she feared death from cancer. During her childhood she had seen a woman who had cancer and the sight had so impressed itself upon her mind that she began to look for the symptoms of cancer in her own body. She was sure that every little ache and pain was the beginning of her long-looked-for symptom of cancer. I have seen her place her hand on her breast and have heard her exclaim, &#x201C;Oh, I am sure I have a cancer growing here. I can feel it.&#x201D; When complaining of this imaginary disease, she always placed her hand on her left breast, where she believed the cancer was attacking her.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idhsvyyah0h">For more than twenty years she kept this up.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id3n0h33jgj">A few weeks ago she died&#x2014;<span class="itali">with</span> <span class="itali">cancer</span> <span class="itali">on</span> <span class="itali">her</span> <span class="itali">left</span> <span class="itali">breast!</span> If suggestion will actually turn the edge of a plank into a guillotine blade and transform healthy body cells into parasites out of which cancer will develop, can you not imagine what it will do in destroying disease germs, if properly directed? <span class="itali">Suggestion</span> is the law through which mental healers work what appear to be miracles. I have personally witnessed the removal of parasitical growths known as warts, through the aid of suggestion, within forty-eight hours.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idtsii1jl1o"><span class="itali">You&#x2014;</span>the reader of this lesson&#x2014;can be sent to bed with <span class="itali">imaginary</span> sickness of the worst sort, in two hours&#x2019; time or less, through the use of <span class="itali">suggestion.</span> If you should start down the street and three or four people in whom you had confidence should meet you and each exclaim that you look ill you would be ready for a doctor. This brings to mind an experience that I once had with a life insurance salesman. I had made application for a policy, but was undecided as to whether I would take ten or twenty thousand dollars. Meanwhile, the agent had sent me to the life insurance company&#x2019;s doctor to be examined. The following day I was called back for another examination. The second time the examination was more searching, and the doctor carried a worried look on his face. The third day I was called back again, and this time two consulting physicians were there to look me over. They gave me the most searching examination I had ever received or even heard of.</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="id00jx0xftx">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-VerseEpiv" id="idte99ic495">Half the wrecks that strew life&#x2019;s ocean</p><p class="Epigraph-VerseEpiv" id="idiw3dl1w75">If some star had been their guide,</p><p class="Epigraph-VerseEpiv" id="id9kv1z7st1">Might in safety now be riding,</p><p class="Epigraph-VerseEpiv" id="idfnl3z11ht">But they drifted with the Tide.</p><p class="ENDEND" id="idhe3vd2vj5">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idelok4jkrh">The next day the agent called on me and addressed me as follows:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idfhenhb2mm">&#x201C;I do not wish to alarm you! but the doctors who examined you do not agree on your analysis. You have not yet decided whether you will take ten or twenty thousand dollars&#x2019; worth of insurance, and I do not think it fair for me to give you a report on your medical examination until you make this decision, because if I did you might feel that I was urging you to take the larger amount.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddgevm58ue">Then I spoke up and said: &#x201C;Well, I have already decided to take the full amount.&#x201D; True enough; I had decided to take the full twenty thousand dollar policy. <span class="itali">I</span> <span class="itali">decided</span> <span class="itali">the</span> <span class="itali">moment</span> <span class="itali">the</span> <span class="itali">agent</span> <span class="itali">planted</span> <span class="itali">the</span> <span class="itali">suggestion</span> <span class="itali">in</span> <span class="itali">my</span> <span class="itali">mind</span> <span class="itali">that</span> <span class="itali">perhaps</span> <span class="itali">I</span> <span class="itali">had</span> <span class="itali">some</span> <span class="itali">constitutional</span> <span class="itali">weakness</span> <span class="itali">that</span> <span class="itali">would</span> <span class="itali">make</span> <span class="itali">it</span> <span class="itali">hard</span> <span class="itali">for</span> <span class="itali">me</span> <span class="itali">to</span> <span class="itali">get</span> <span class="itali">as</span> <span class="itali">much</span> <span class="itali">insurance</span> <span class="itali">as</span> <span class="itali">I</span> <span class="itali">wanted.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idj27ektgej">&#x201C;Very well,&#x201D; said the agent, &#x201C;now that you have decided I feel it my duty to tell you that two of the doctors believe you have the tubercular germ in your system, while the other two disagree with them.&#x201D; The trick had been turned.

Of course you will not!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id8f48080s8">A few months ago I received one of the most effective pieces of advertising I ever saw. It was a neat little book in which a clever automobile insurance salesman had reprinted press dispatches that he had gathered from all over the country, in which it was shown that sixty-five automobiles had been stolen in a single day. On the back page of the book was this highly <span class="itali">suggestive</span> statement:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idti426h122"><span class="itali">&#x201C;Your</span> <span class="itali">car</span> <span class="itali">may</span> <span class="itali">be</span> <span class="itali">the</span> <span class="itali">next</span> <span class="itali">one</span> <span class="itali">to</span> <span class="itali">go.</span> <span class="itali">Is</span> <span class="itali">it</span> <span class="itali">insured?&#x201D;</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idliq08cv8f">At the bottom of the page was the salesman&#x2019;s name and address; also his telephone number.

He came right over to see me, and you know the remainder of the story.</p><p class="Blank-Space-BreakBsbrk" id="idzi2sjr8fr">[blank]</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id46krcwl62">Go back, now, to the two letters and let us analyze the second one, which brought the desired replies from all to whom it was sent. Study, carefully, the first paragraph and you will observe that it asks a question which can be answered in but one way. Compare this opening paragraph with that of the first letter, by asking yourself which of the two would have impressed you most favorably. This paragraph is worded as it is for a two-fold purpose; first, it is intended to serve the purpose of neutralizing the mind of the reader so he will read the remainder of the letter in an open-minded attitude; and, second, it asks a question which can be answered in but one way, for the purpose of committing the reader to a viewpoint which harmonizes with the nature of the service that he is to be requested to render in subsequent paragraphs of the letter.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id05oe2mjtf">In the second lesson of this course you observed that Andrew Carnegie refused to answer my question, when I asked him to what he attributed his <span class="itali">success,</span> until he had asked me to define the word <span class="itali">success.</span> He did this to avoid misunderstanding. The first paragraph of the letter we are analyzing is so worded that it states the object of the letter and at the same time practically forces the reader to accept that object as being sound and reasonable.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idp9lrf8vuy">Any person who would answer the question asked in this paragraph of the letter under discussion, in the negative, would, by the same answer, convict himself on the charge of selfishness, and no man wants to face himself with a guilty conscience on such a charge. Just as the farmer first plows his ground, then fertilizes it, and perhaps harrows it and prepares it to receive the seed, in order that he may be sure of a crop, so does this paragraph fertilize the mind of the reader and prepare it for the seed which is to be placed there through the subtle <span class="itali">suggestion</span> that the paragraph contains.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ids9pfswkdr">Study, carefully, the second paragraph of the letter and you will observe that it carries a statement of fact which the reader can <span class="itali">neither</span> <span class="itali">question</span> <span class="itali">nor</span> <span class="itali">deny!</span> It provides him with no reason for argument because it is obviously based upon a sound fundamental. It takes him the second step of the psychological journey that leads straight toward compliance with the request that is carefully clothed and covered up in the third paragraph of the letter, but you will notice that the third paragraph begins by paying the reader a nice little compliment that was not designed to make him angry. &#x201C;Therefore, if you will write me of your views as to the most essential points to be borne in mind by those who are offering personal services for sale,&#x201D; etc. Study the wording of this sentence, together with the setting in which it has been placed, and you will observe that it hardly appears to be a request at all, and certainly there is nothing about it to suggest that the <span class="itali">writer</span> <span class="itali">of</span> <span class="itali">the</span> <span class="itali">letter</span> <span class="itali">is</span> <span class="itali">requesting</span> <span class="itali">a</span> <span class="itali">favor</span> <span class="itali">for</span> <span class="itali">his</span> <span class="itali">personal</span> <span class="itali">benefit.</span> At most, it can be construed merely as a request for a favor for others.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idmedr6hzxp">Now study the closing paragraph and notice how tactfully concealed is the suggestion that if the reader should refuse the request he is placing himself in the awkward position of one who does not care enough about those who are less fortunate than himself to spend a two cent stamp and a few minutes of time for their benefit.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idtbo1p55lh">From start to finish the letter conveys its strongest impressions by mere <span class="itali">suggestion,</span> yet this suggestion is so carefully covered that it is not obvious except upon careful analysis of the entire letter.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id4ccax266p">The whole construction of the letter is such that if the reader lays it aside without complying with the request it makes <span class="itali">he</span> <span class="itali">will</span> <span class="itali">have</span> <span class="itali">to</span> <span class="itali">reckon</span> <span class="itali">with</span> <span class="itali">his</span> <span class="itali">own</span> <span class="itali">conscience!</span> This effect is intensified by the last sentence of the last paragraph and especially by the last thirteen words of that sentence, &#x201C;who will <span class="itali">read</span> <span class="itali">your</span> <span class="itali">message,</span> <span class="itali">believe</span> <span class="itali">in</span> <span class="itali">it,</span> <span class="itali">and</span> <span class="itali">be</span> <span class="itali">guided</span> <span class="itali">by</span> <span class="itali">it.&#x201D;</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idtd6pf28sl">This letter brings the reader up with a bang and turns his own conscience into an ally of the writer; it corners him, just as a hunter might corner a rabbit by driving it into a carefully prepared net.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id5a4cdtue8">The best evidence that this analysis is correct is the fact that the letter brought replies from every person to whom it was sent, despite the fact that every one of these men was of the type that we speak of as being a man of affairs&#x2014;the type that is generally supposed to be too busy to answer a letter of this nature.

Perhaps that was one reason why they were <span class="itali">really</span> big men.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id0w4wnswqo">The human mind is a marvelous piece of machinery!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id8ltdz162q">One of its outstanding characteristics is noticed in the fact that all impressions which reach it, either through outside <span class="itali">suggestion</span> or Auto-suggestion, are recorded together in groups which harmonize in nature. The negative impressions are stored away, all in one portion of the brain, while the positive impressions are stored in another portion. When one of these impressions (or past experiences) is called into the conscious mind, through the principle of memory, there is a tendency to recall with it all others of a similar nature, just as the raising of one link of a chain brings up other links with it. For example, anything that causes a feeling of doubt to arise in a person&#x2019;s mind is sufficient to call forth all of his experiences which caused him to become doubtful. If a man is asked by a stranger to cash a check, immediately he remembers having cashed checks that were not good, or of having heard of others who did so. Through the law of association all similar emotions, experiences and sense impressions that reach the mind are filed away together, so that the recalling of one has a tendency to bring back to memory all the others.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id4uk0648yw">To arouse a feeling of distrust in a person&#x2019;s mind has a tendency to bring to the surface every doubt-building experience that person ever had. For this reason successful salesmen endeavor to keep away from the discussion of subjects that may arouse the buyer&#x2019;s &#x201C;chain of doubt impressions&#x201D; which he has stored away by reason of previous experiences. The successful salesman quickly learns that &#x201C;knocking&#x201D; a competitor or a competing article may result in bringing to the buyer&#x2019;s mind certain negative emotions growing out of previous experiences which may make it impossible for the salesman to &#x201C;neutralize&#x201D; the buyer&#x2019;s mind.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9l1a0tm4i">This principle applies to and controls every sense impression that is lodged in the human mind. Take the feeling of fear, for example; the moment we permit a single emotion that is related to fear to reach the conscious mind, it calls with it all of its unsavory relations. A feeling of courage cannot claim the attention of the conscious mind while a feeling of fear is there. One or the other must dominate. They make poor room-mates because they do not harmonize in nature. Like attracts like. Every thought held in the conscious mind has a tendency to draw to it other thoughts of a similar nature. You see, therefore, that these feelings, thoughts and emotions growing out of past experiences, which claim the attention of the conscious mind, are backed by a regular army of supporting soldiers of a similar nature, that stand ready to aid them in their work.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idj0wov6tip">Deliberately place in your own mind, through the principle of Auto-suggestion, the ambition to succeed through the aid of a <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">chief</span> <span class="itali">aim,</span> and notice how quickly all of your latent or undeveloped ability in the nature of past experiences will become stimulated and aroused to action in your behalf.

Meanwhile, the little colored boy shined first one and then the other shoe, taking plenty of time and doing a first-class job.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id5zdurj48k">After the job was finished Mr. Chalmers handed the boy a dime, then went ahead with his speech:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id0nshj4gpj">&#x201C;I want each of you,&#x201D; said he, &#x201C;to take a good look at this little colored boy. He has the concession for shoe-shining throughout our plant and offices. His predecessor was a white boy, considerably older than himself, and despite the fact that the company subsidized him with a salary of $5.00 a week he could not make a living in this plant, where thousands of people are employed.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idub3eo8xhv">&#x201C;This little colored boy not only makes a good living, without any subsidy from the company, but he is actually saving money out of his earnings each week, working under the same conditions, in the same plant, for the same people.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idm9w0vhiw4">&#x201C;Now I wish to ask you a question: Whose fault was it that the white boy did not get more business? Was it his fault, or the fault of his buyers?&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idcepivxo8m">In a mighty roar from the crowd the answer came back:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idovgpblgum">&#x201C;IT WAS THE BOY&#x2019;S FAULT, OF COURSE!&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id5itir5hfa">&#x201C;Just so,&#x201D; replied Chalmers, &#x201C;and now I want to tell you this, that you are selling Cash Registers in the same territory, to the same people, with exactly the same business conditions that existed a year ago, yet you are not producing the business that you were then. Now whose fault is that? Is it yours, or the buyer&#x2019;s?&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idjh8xg7k38">And again the answer came back with a roar:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idbkmaf1od1">&#x201C;IT IS OUR FAULT, OF COURSE!&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id37p66hicx">&#x201C;I am glad that you are frank to acknowledge your faults,&#x201D; Chalmers continued, &#x201C;and I now wish to tell you what your trouble is: You have heard rumors about this company being in financial trouble and that has killed off your enthusiasm so that you are not making the effort that you formerly made. If you will go back into your territories with a definite promise to send in five orders each during the next thirty days this company will no longer be in financial difficulty, for that additional business will see us clear. Will you do it?&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idydv37czow">They said they would, and they did!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idt028iqvpj">That incident has gone down in the history of the National Cash Register Company under the name of Hugh Chalmers&#x2019; Million Dollar Shoe Shine, for it is said that this turned the tide in the company&#x2019;s affairs and was worth millions of dollars.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idhjyaev63r">Enthusiasm knows no defeat! The Sales Manager who knows how to send out an army of enthusiastic salespeople may set his own price on his services, and what is more important even than this, he can increase the earning capacity of every person under his direction; thus, his enthusiasm benefits not only himself but perhaps hundreds of others.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idwkyo3zb00">Enthusiasm is never a matter of chance. There are certain stimuli which produce enthusiasm, the most important of these being as follows:</p><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idjbru21zcx"><span class="boldb">1. </span>Occupation in work which one loves best.</p><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idrcdk9o5r3"><span class="boldb">2. </span>Environment where one comes in contact with others who are enthusiastic and optimistic.</p><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idsons5l0pp"><span class="boldb">3. </span>Financial success.</p><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idu7wwg2k1b"><span class="boldb">4. </span>Complete mastery and application, in one&#x2019;s daily work, of the Fifteen Laws of Success.</p><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idtaxpvukix"><span class="boldb">5. </span>Good health.</p><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="id6qz3pxlgd"><span class="boldb">6. </span>Knowledge that one has served others in some helpful manner.</p><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idpqqj63bi9"><span class="boldb">7. </span>Good clothes, appropriate to the needs of one&#x2019;s occupation.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idx2pdeteak">All of these seven sources of stimuli are self-explanatory with the exception of the last. The psychology of clothes is understood by very few people, and for this reason it will be here explained in detail. Clothes constitute the most important part of the embellishment which every person must have in order to feel self-reliant, hopeful and enthusiastic.</p><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="iddw1w2p8nd">The Psychology of Good Clothes</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idah9vidxqz">When the good news came from the theater of war, on November the eleventh, 1918, my worldly possessions amounted to but little more than they did the day I came into the world.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idy8n8dlvyg">The war had destroyed my business and made it necessary for me to make a new start!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id7fcmednhc">My wardrobe consisted of three well worn business suits and two uniforms which I no longer needed.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idlnn7dz6lv">Knowing all too well that the world forms its first and most lasting impressions of a man by the clothes he wears, I lost no time in visiting my tailor.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idgvy62nya5">Happily, my tailor had known me for many years, therefore he did not judge me entirely by the clothes I wore.

This was the thought which was running through my mind, with hope against hope that the question would not be brought up.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id0i7uu5pog">I then visited my haberdasher, from whom I purchased three less expensive suits and a complete supply of the best shirts, collars, ties, hosiery and underwear that he carried.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id8pfbkldqz">My bill at the haberdasher&#x2019;s amounted to a little over $300.00.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idimraq3jdc">With an air of prosperity I nonchalantly signed the charge ticket and tossed it back to the salesman, with instructions to deliver my purchase the following morning. The feeling of renewed self-reliance and success had begun to come over me, even before I had attired myself in my newly purchased outfit.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idyd5g8t89v">I was out of the war and $675.00 in debt, all in less than twenty-four hours.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idiuzjwevss">The following day the first of the three suits ordered from the haberdasher was delivered. I put it on at once, stuffed a new silk handkerchief in the outside pocket of my coat, shoved the $50.00 I had borrowed on my ring down into my pants pocket, and walked down Michigan Boulevard, in Chicago, feeling as rich as Rockefeller.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idvklzjxsz1">Every article of clothing I wore, from my underwear out, was of the very best. That it was not paid for was nobody&#x2019;s business except mine and my tailor&#x2019;s and my haberdasher&#x2019;s.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idgmpgqlw9g">Every morning I dressed myself in an entirely new outfit, and walked down the same street, at precisely the same hour. That hour &#x201C;happened&#x201D; to be the time when a certain wealthy publisher usually walked down the same street, on his way to lunch.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idvfvy66sgn">I made it my business to speak to him each day, and occasionally I would stop for a minute&#x2019;s chat with him.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idi8cszrqe5">After this daily meeting had been going on for about a week I met this publisher one day, but decided I would see if he would let me get by without speaking.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idugbmvtuk2">Watching him from under my eyelashes I looked straight ahead, and started to pass him when he stopped and motioned me over to the edge of the sidewalk, placed his hand on my shoulder, looked me over from head to foot, and said: &#x201C;You look damned prosperous for a man who has just laid aside a uniform. Who makes your clothes?&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idwbo7xs254">&#x201C;Well,&#x201D; said I, &#x201C;Wilkie &amp; Sellery made this particular suit.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idtmvjj7tlm">He then wanted to know what sort of business I was engaged in. That &#x201C;airy&#x201D; atmosphere of prosperity which I had been wearing, along with a new and different suit every day, had got the better of his curiosity. (I had hoped that it would.)</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idwpujw2yrt">Flipping the ashes from my Havana perfecto, I said &#x201C;Oh, I am preparing the copy for a new magazine that I am going to publish.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id5k7l0jo2n">&#x201C;A new magazine, eh?&#x201D; he queried, &#x201C;and what are you going to call it?&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id3nlvskfli">&#x201C;It is to be named <span class="itali">Hill&#x2019;s</span> <span class="itali">Golden</span> <span class="itali">Rule.&#x201D;</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idaerko9n8w">&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t forget,&#x201D; said my publisher friend, &#x201C;that I am in the business of printing and distributing magazines. Perhaps I can serve you, also.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9t1pbtnjh">That was the moment for which I had been waiting. I had that very moment, and almost the very spot of ground on which we stood, in mind when I was purchasing those new suits.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idu68l7dnvh">But, is it necessary to remind you, that conversation never would have taken place had this publisher observed me walking down that street from day to day, with a &#x201C;whipped-dog&#x201D; look on my face, an unpressed suit on my back and a look of poverty in my eyes.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idnnvtfv9ye">An appearance of prosperity attracts attention always, with no exceptions whatsover. Moreover, a look of prosperity attracts &#x201C;favorable attention,&#x201D; because the one dominating desire in every human heart is to be prosperous.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id6zoy14v0s">My publisher friend invited me to his club for lunch. Before the coffee and cigars had been served he had &#x201C;talked me out of&#x201D; the contract for printing and distributing my magazine. I had even &#x201C;consented&#x201D; to permit him to supply the capital, without any interest charge.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idohr4cypfe">For the benefit of those who are not familiar with the publishing business may I not offer the information that considerable capital is required for launching a new nationally distributed magazine.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idlwqrr1m2f">Capital, in such large amounts, is often hard to get, even with the best of security. The capital necessary for launching <span class="itali">Hill&#x2019;s</span> <span class="itali">Golden</span> <span class="itali">Rule</span> magazine, which you may have read, was well above $30,000.00, and every cent of it was raised on a &#x201C;front&#x201D; created mostly by good clothes. True, there may have been some ability back of those clothes, but many millions of men have ability who never have anything else, and who are never heard of outside of the limited community in which they live. This is a rather sad truth!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id6jekg4u44">To some it may seem an unpardonable extravagance for one who was &#x201C;broke&#x201D; to have gone in debt for $675.00 worth of clothes, but the psychology back of that investment more than justified it.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idym1yo75uh">The appearance of prosperity not only made a favorable impression on those to whom I had to look for favors, but of more importance still was the effect that proper attire HAD ON ME.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idvmbjihgh0">I not only knew that correct clothes would impress others favorably, but I knew also that good clothes would give me an atmosphere of self-reliance, without which I could not hope to regain my lost fortunes.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9e4zng3ty">I got my first training in the psychology of good clothes from my friend Edwin C. Barnes, who is a close business associate of Thomas A. Edison. Barnes afforded considerable amusement for the Edison staff when, some twenty-odd years ago, he rode into West Orange on a freight train (not being able to raise sufficient money for passenger fare) and announced at the Edison offices that he had come to enter into a partnership with Mr. Edison.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id5py1a3lit">Nearly everybody around the Edison plant laughed at Barnes, except Edison himself. He saw something in the square jaw and determined face of young Barnes which most of the others did not see, despite the fact that the young man looked more like a tramp than he did a future partner of the greatest inventor on earth.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idfnpswkhfb">Barnes got his start, sweeping floors in the Edison offices!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idozsbxsprn">That was all he sought&#x2014;just a chance to get a toehold in the Edison organization. From there on he made history that is well worth emulation by other young men who wish to make places for themselves.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idhkeovbskq">Barnes has now retired from active business, even though he is still a comparatively young man, and spends most of his time at his two beautiful homes in Bradentown, Florida, and Damariscotta, Maine. He is a multimillionaire, prosperous and happy.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1l3g7oa3w">I first became acquainted with Barnes during the early days of his association with Edison, before he had &#x201C;arrived.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idsbvnqba6e">In those days he had the largest and most expensive collection of clothes I had ever seen or heard of one man owning. His wardrobe consisted of thirty-one suits; one for each day of the month. He never wore the same suit two days in succession.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id43wj0g3i5">Moreover, all his suits were of the most expensive type. (Incidentally, his clothes were made by the same tailors who made those three suits for me.)</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id373mas4j1">He wore socks which cost six dollars per pair.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idt18ewyfvh">His shirts and other wearing apparel cost in similar proportion. His cravats were specially made, at a cost of from five to seven dollars and a half each.</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="idcqxl41b6p">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="idno30a7lv5">There is a suitable reward for every virtue and appropriate punishment for every sin a man commits.

He said he had to walk around the plant a dozen times before he worked up enough courage to announce himself, because he knew that he looked more like a tramp than he did a desirable employee.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idd1enqm46p">Barnes is said to be the most able salesman ever connected with the great inventor of West Orange. His entire fortune was made through his ability as a salesman, but he has often said that he never could have accomplished the results which have made him both wealthy and famous had it not been for his understanding of the psychology of clothes.</p><p class="Blank-Space-BreakBsbrk" id="ided9a43yui">[blank]</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9cq75rxms">I have met many salesman in my time. During the past ten years I have personally trained and directed the efforts of more than 3,000 salespeople, both men and women, and I have observed that, without a single exception, the star producers were all people who understood and made good use of the psychology of clothes.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idu3esns4bv">I have seen a few well dressed people who made no outstanding records as salesmen, but I have yet to see the first poorly dressed man who became a star producer in the field of selling.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idde3h94ve0">I have studied the psychology of clothes for so long, and I have watched its effect on people in so many different walks of life, that I am fully convinced there is a close connection between clothes and success.</p><p class="Blank-Space-BreakBsbrk" id="id27ekum6o6">[blank]</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id0f2v9oxk6">Personally I feel no need of thirty-one suits of clothes, but if my personality demanded a wardrobe of this size I would manage to get it, no matter how much it might cost.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idzapl1i0mq">To be well dressed a man should have at least ten suits of clothes. He should have a different suit for each of the seven days of the week, a full dress suit and a Tuxedo, for formal evening occasions, and a cutaway for formal afternoon occasions.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ideit64a7hq">For summer wear he should have an assortment of at least four appropriate light suits, with blue coat and white flannel trousers for informal afternoon and evening occasions. If he plays golf he should have at least one golf suit.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idog2gkkr0u">This, of course, is for the man who is a notch or two above the &#x201C;mediocre&#x201D; class.

His stimulus was liquor. (The author wishes it distinctly understood that he does not recommend the use of alcoholic or narcotic stimuli, for any purpose whatsoever, as either will eventually destroy both body and mind of all who use them.)

Seated in a room that has been artistically decorated to suit his own taste, under lights that have been colored, tinted and softened, these beautiful young ladies, dressed in handsome evening gowns, play his favorite music. To use his own words, &#x201C;I become drunk with enthusiasm, under the influence of this environment, and rise to heights I never know or feel on other occasions. It is then that I do my work.

It is a part of your business not to permit them to interfere with you when you approach one of these crossroads.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idyu4jssoio">Both individuals and nations rapidly decline where GREED and ENVY ride in the minds of those who dominate.

It came about in this way:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idjdnzvp4w3">One day, in the building in which I had my office, the janitor and I had a misunderstanding. This led to a most violent form of mutual dislike between us. As a means of showing his contempt for me, this janitor would switch off the electric lights of the building when he knew that I was there alone at work in my study. This happened on several occasions until I finally decided to &#x201C;strike back.&#x201D; My opportunity came one Sunday when I came to my study to prepare an address that I had to deliver the following night. I had hardly seated myself at my desk when off went the lights.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idosnvpuj65">I jumped to my feet and ran toward the basement of the building where I knew I would find the janitor. When I arrived, I found him busily engaged, shoveling coal into the furnace, and whistling as though nothing unusual had happened.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idzpnfuqcxd">Without ceremony I pitched into him, and for five minutes I hurled adjectives at him which were hotter than the fire that he was feeding. Finally, I ran out of words and had to slow down. Then he straightened himself up, looked back over his shoulder, and in a calm, smooth tone of voice that was full of poise and <span class="itali">self-control,</span> and with a smile on his face that reached from ear to ear, he said:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idf3hw7yw6v"><span class="itali">&#x201C;Why,</span> <span class="itali">you-all&#x2019;s</span> <span class="itali">just</span> <span class="itali">a</span> <span class="itali">little</span> <span class="itali">bit</span> <span class="itali">excited</span> <span class="itali">this</span> <span class="itali">morning,</span> <span class="itali">ain&#x2019;t</span> <span class="itali">you?&#x201D;</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idgj1esgaba">That remark cut as though it had been a stiletto!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idjf63p0gl7">Imagine my feelings as I stood there before an illiterate man who could neither read nor write, but who, despite this handicap, had defeated me in a duel that had been fought on grounds&#x2014;and with a weapon&#x2014;of my own choice.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idyet282rm8">My conscience pointed an accusing finger at me.

There was nothing else for me to do. As I began to think the matter over I saw my mistake, but, true to nature, I was reluctant to do that which I knew must be done to right the wrong. I knew that I would have to apologize to that man before I could place myself at peace in my own heart, much less with him. Finally, I made up my mind to go back down to the basement and suffer this humility which I knew I had to undergo. The decision was not easily reached, nor did I reach it quickly.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idjxb7ufi9t">I started down, but I walked more slowly than I had when I went down the first trip. I was trying to think how I would make the second approach so as to suffer the least humiliation possible.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idbe993u070">When I got to the basement I called to the janitor to come over to the door. In a calm, kindly tone of voice he asked:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idlzbcm7rfr">&#x201C;What do you wish this time?&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ide4oy5t488">I informed him that I had come back to apologize for the wrong I had done, if he would permit me to do so.

My pen began to take on greater power. My spoken words began to carry greater weight. I began to make more friends and fewer enemies among men of my acquaintance. The incident marked one of the most important turning-points of my life. It taught me that no man can control others unless he first controls himself. It gave me a clear conception of the philosophy back of these words, &#x201C;Whom the gods would destroy, they first make mad.&#x201D; It also gave me a clear conception of the law of non-resistance and helped me interpret many passages of the holy scriptures, bearing on the subject of this law, as I had never before interpreted them.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id01n28gvvm">This incident placed in my hands the pass-key to a storehouse of knowledge that is illuminating and helpful in all that I do, and, later in life, when enemies sought to destroy me, it gave me a powerful weapon of defense that has never failed me.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idfo9epfzd7">Lack of <span class="itali">self-control</span> is the average salesman&#x2019;s most damaging weakness. The prospective buyer says something that the salesman does not wish to hear, and, if he has not this quality of <span class="itali">self-control,</span> he will &#x201C;strike back&#x201D; with a counter remark that is fatal to his sale.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idikyxfkmru">In one of the large department stores of Chicago I witnessed an incident that illustrated the importance of <span class="itali">self-control.</span> A long line of women were in front of the &#x201C;complaint&#x201D; desk, telling their troubles and <span class="itali">the</span> <span class="itali">store&#x2019;s</span> <span class="itali">faults</span> to the young woman in charge. Some of the women were angry and unreasonable and some of them made very ugly remarks. The young woman at the desk received the disgruntled women without the slightest sign of resentment at their remarks. With a smile on her face she directed these women to the proper departments with such charming grace and poise that I marveled at her <span class="itali">self-control.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id323qqkpyi">Standing just back of her was another young woman who was making notations on slips of paper and passing them in front of her, as the women in the line unburdened their troubles. These slips of paper contained the gist of what the women in the line were saying, minus the &#x201C;vitriolic coloring&#x201D; and the anger.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idkc8544xpb">The smiling young woman at the desk who was &#x201C;hearing&#x201D; the complaints was <span class="itali">stone</span> <span class="itali">deaf!</span> Her assistant supplied her with all the necessary facts, through those slips of paper.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id7lyppvtw0">I was so impressed with the plan that I sought the manager of the store and interviewed him.

They came before her growling like wolves and went away as meek and quiet as sheep. In fact some of them had &#x201C;sheepish&#x201D; looks on their faces as they left, because the young woman&#x2019;s <span class="itali">self-control</span> had made them ashamed of themselves.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idcvhiysccs">Ever since I witnessed that scene, I have thought of the poise and self-control of that young woman at the desk every time I felt myself becoming irritated at remarks which I did not like, and often I have thought that everybody should have a set of &#x201C;mental ear muffs&#x201D; which they could slip over their ears at times. Personally, I have developed the habit of &#x201C;closing&#x201D; my ears against much of the idle chatter such as I used to make it my business to resent.

He remained calm and seemed to enjoy all the mean things the others said about the &#x201C;Tiger&#x201D; of Tammany Hall.

One lady who looked to be about forty-five years of age crawled on her hands and knees through the crowd and &#x201C;bobbed&#x201D; up in front of a customer who had engaged the attention of the saleswoman ahead of her. In a loud, high-pitched tone of voice she demanded attention. The saleswoman was a diplomat who understood human nature; she also possessed <span class="itali">self-control,</span> for she smiled sweetly at the intruder and said: &#x201C;Yes, <span class="itali">Miss;</span> I will be with you in a moment!&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iduxryw4drj">The intruder calmed herself!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idjdqeoa8z4">I do not know whether it was the &#x201C;Yes, <span class="itali">Miss,&#x201D;</span> or the sweet tone in which it was said that modified her attitude; but it was one or the other; perhaps it was both.

It happened the day after Thanksgiving, when I called at his office for the purpose of introducing him to a prominent Russian who had come to the United States to publish a book. The Russian spoke broken English and it was therefore hard for him to make himself easily understood. During the interview he asked my printer friend a question which was mistaken as a reflection upon his ability as a printer. In an unguarded moment he countered with this remark:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idrmf7jcoec">&#x201C;The trouble with you Bolsheviks is that you look with suspicion on the remainder of the world just because of your own short-sightedness.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idgt4hcs210">My &#x201C;Bolshevik&#x201D; friend nudged me on the elbow and whispered:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idqetzu7msj">&#x201C;The gentleman seems to be sick.

This concern has in its employ a very clever woman who visits department stores and other places where salespeople are employed and selects certain ones whom she believes to possess tact and <span class="itali">self-control;</span> but, to be sure of her judgment, she approaches these salespeople and has them show her their wares. She asks all sorts of questions that are designed to try their patience. If they stand the test, they are offered better positions; if they fail in the test, they have merely allowed a good opportunity to pass by without knowing it.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idnnrrpihx6">No doubt all people who refuse or neglect to exercise <span class="itali">self-control</span> are literally turning opportunity after opportunity away without knowing it. One day I was standing at the glove counter of a large retail store talking to a young man who was employed there. He was telling me that he had been with the store four years, but on account of the &#x201C;short-sightedness&#x201D; of the store, his services had not been appreciated and he was looking for another position. In the midst of this conversation a customer walked up to him and asked to see some hats. He paid no attention to the customer&#x2019;s inquiry until he had finished telling me his troubles, despite the fact that the customer was obviously becoming impatient. Finally, he turned to the customer and said: &#x201C;This isn&#x2019;t the hat department.&#x201D; When the customer inquired as to where he might find that department the young man replied: &#x201C;Ask the floor-walker over there; he will direct you.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id6ggersbma">For four years this young man had been standing on top of a fine opportunity but he did not know it. He could have made a friend of every person whom he served in that store and these friends could have made him one of the most valuable men in the store, because they would have come back to trade with him. &#x201C;Snappy&#x201D; answers to inquiring customers do not bring them back.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddee8cop80">One rainy afternoon an old lady walked into a Pittsburgh department store and wandered around in an aimless sort of way, very much in the manner that people who have no intention of buying often do. Most of the salespeople gave her the &#x201C;once over&#x201D; and busied themselves by straightening the stock on their shelves so as to avoid being troubled by her. One of the young men saw her and made it his business to inquire politely if he might serve her. She informed him that she was only waiting for it to stop raining; that she did not wish to make any purchases. The young man assured her that she was welcome, and by engaging her in conversation made her feel that he had meant what he said. When she was ready to go he accompanied her to the street and raised her umbrella for her. She asked for his card and went on her way.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id7js1ghfc8">The incident had been forgotten by the young man when, one day, he was called into the office by the head of the firm and shown a letter from a lady who wanted a salesman to go to Scotland and take an order for the furnishings for a mansion.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idpd6b6pvnd">That lady was Andrew Carnegie&#x2019;s mother; she was also the same woman whom the young man had so courteously escorted to the street many months previously.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idi0m8asxz3">In the letter, Mrs. Carnegie specified that this young man was the one whom she desired to be sent to take her order. That order amounted to an enormous sum, and the incident brought the young man an opportunity for advancement that he might never have had except for his courtesy to an old lady who did not look like a &#x201C;ready sale.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id96h0kh3rc">Just as the great fundamental laws of life are wrapped up in the commonest sort of everyday experiences that most of us never notice, so are the <span class="itali">real</span> opportunities often hidden in the seemingly unimportant transactions of life.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idqjfdkq7hv">Ask the next ten people whom you meet why they have not accomplished more in their respective lines of endeavor, and at least nine of them will tell you that <span class="itali">opportunity</span> <span class="itali">does</span> <span class="itali">not</span> <span class="itali">seem</span> <span class="itali">to</span> <span class="itali">come</span> <span class="itali">around</span> <span class="itali">their</span> <span class="itali">way.</span> Go a step further and analyze each of these nine accurately by observing their actions for one single day, and the chances are that you will find that every one of them is turning away the finest sort of opportunities every hour of the day.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idrsxmm3v7z">One day I went to visit a friend who was associated with a Commercial School, in the capacity of solicitor.

In fact my account with the school is overdrawn and I am thinking about changing positions as there is no <span class="itali">opportunity</span> here.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idf2szycvw0">It happened that I was on my vacation and had ten days&#x2019; time that I could use as I wished, so I challenged his remark that he had no opportunity by telling him that I could turn his position into $250.00 in a week&#x2019;s time and show him how to make it worth that every week thereafter. He looked at me in amazement and asked me not to joke with him over so serious a matter. When he was finally convinced that I was in earnest he ventured to inquire how I would perform the &#x201C;miracle.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idzli4og3wd">Then I asked him if he had ever heard of <span class="itali">organized</span> <span class="itali">effort,</span> to which he replied: <span class="itali">&#x201C;What</span> <span class="itali">do</span> <span class="itali">you</span> <span class="itali">mean</span> <span class="itali">by</span> <span class="itali">organized</span> <span class="itali">effort?&#x201D;</span> I informed him that I had reference to the direction of his efforts in such a manner that he would enroll from five to ten students with the same amount of effort that he had been putting into the enrollment of one or of none. He said he was willing to be shown, so I gave him instructions to arrange for me to speak before the employees of one of the local department stores. He made the appointment and I delivered the address. In my talk I outlined a plan through which the employees could not only increase their ability so that they could earn more money in their present positions, but it also offered them an opportunity to prepare themselves for greater responsibilities and better positions. Following my talk, which of course was designed for that purpose, my friend enrolled eight of those employees for night courses in the Commercial School which he represented.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idsk743tyo8">The following night he booked me for a similar address before the employees of a laundry, and following the address he enrolled three more students, two of them <span class="itali">young</span> <span class="itali">women</span> <span class="itali">who</span> <span class="itali">worked</span> <span class="itali">over</span> <span class="itali">the</span> <span class="itali">washing</span> <span class="itali">machines</span> <span class="itali">at</span> <span class="itali">the</span> <span class="itali">hardest</span> <span class="itali">sort</span> <span class="itali">of</span> <span class="itali">labor.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idl55yrjzzd">Two days later he booked me for an address before the employees of one of the local banks, and following the address he enrolled four more students, making a total of fifteen students, and the entire time consumed was not more than six hours, including the time required for the delivery of the addresses and the enrollment of the students.</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="idahrupcfx9">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="ido6v02tsb6">Fear no man, hate no man, wish no one misfortune, and more than likely you will have plenty of friends.</p><p class="ENDEND" id="idnzsbktczr">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddyok5w5tt">My friend&#x2019;s commission on the transactions was a little over four hundred dollars!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idh2q33xc9t">These places of employment were within fifteen minutes&#x2019; walk of this man&#x2019;s place of business, but he had never thought of looking there for business.

By some queer turn of the wheel of fate one of these destroyers crossed my path by making it his business to try to destroy my reputation. At first, I was inclined to &#x201C;strike back&#x201D; at him, but as I sat at my typewriter late one night, a thought came to me which changed my entire attitude toward this man. Removing the sheet of paper that was in my typewriter, I inserted another one on which I stated this thought, in these words:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idx5ie2fmp2"><span class="itali">You</span> <span class="itali">have</span> <span class="itali">a</span> <span class="itali">tremendous</span> <span class="itali">advantage</span> <span class="itali">over</span> <span class="itali">the</span> <span class="itali">man</span> <span class="itali">who</span> <span class="itali">does</span> <span class="itali">you</span> <span class="itali">an</span> <span class="itali">injury:</span> <span class="itali">you</span> <span class="itali">have</span> <span class="itali">it</span> <span class="itali">within</span> <span class="itali">your</span> <span class="itali">power</span> <span class="itali">to</span> <span class="itali">forgive</span> <span class="itali">him,</span> <span class="itali">while</span> <span class="itali">he</span> <span class="itali">has</span> <span class="itali">no</span> <span class="itali">such</span> <span class="itali">advantage</span> <span class="itali">over</span> <span class="itali">you.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idrn0aoanpo">As I finished writing those lines, I made up my mind that I had come to the point at which I had to decide upon a policy that would serve as a guide concerning my attitude toward those who criticize my work or try to destroy my reputation. I reached this decision by reasoning something after this fashion: Two courses of action were open to me. I could waste much of my time and energy in striking back at those who would try to destroy me, or I could devote this energy to furthering my life-work and let the result of that work serve as my sole answer to all who would criticize my efforts or question my motives.

I paid no attention to these attacks for four or five years, until finally they became so bold that I decided to override my policy and &#x201C;strike back&#x201D; at my antagonist.

You can permit others to select the material out of which your thinking is produced and that is Suggestion. It is a humiliating fact that most thought is produced by the outside suggestions of others, and it is more humiliating, still, to have to admit that the majority of us accept this suggestion without either examining it or questioning its soundness.

Hence a number of my very good readers cherish an opinion that often I have been tempted to correct, a temptation to which I now yield.

Has it occurred to you, born with the proverbial silver spoon in your mouth, that theoretical writing is pretty cold and futile compared to the actual hand-to-mouth struggle that so many of us live, day by day and year in and year out&#x2014;an experience that you know not of?&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idqc4167pdi">&#x201C;An experience that you know not of!&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idzy97s3ks1">Now, how far do the facts square with this statement?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id6oa18rxyn">Whether or not I was born with the proverbial silver spoon in my mouth, I cannot say. It is true that I was born of well-to-do parents. But when I was six years old my father lost all his means, and faced life at forty-five, in a strange country, without even necessaries. There are men and their wives who know what that means; for a man to try to &#x201C;come back&#x201D; at forty-five, and in a strange country!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id41zi4whvm">I had the handicap of not knowing one word of the English language. I went to a public school and learned what I could. And sparse morsels they were! The boys were cruel, as boys are. The teachers were impatient, as tired teachers are.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idv04avgxsy">My father could not find his place in the world. My mother who had always had servants at her beck and call, faced the problems of housekeeping that she had never learned nor been taught. And there was no money.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idul62tvhuo">So, after school hours, my brother and I went home, but not to play. After-school hours meant for us to help a mother who daily grew more frail under the burdens that she could not carry. Not for days, but for years, we two boys got up in the gray cold winter dawn when the beds feel so warm to growing boys, and we sifted the coal ashes of the day-before&#x2019;s fire for a stray lump or two of unburned coal, and with what we had or could find we made the fire and warmed up the room. Then we set the table for the scant breakfast, went to school, and directly after school we washed the dishes, swept and scrubbed the floors. Living in a three-family tenement, each third week meant that we scrubbed the entire three flights of stairs from the third story to the first, as well as the doorsteps and the sidewalk outside. The latter work was the hardest; for we did it on Saturdays, with the boys of the neighborhood looking on none too kindly, so we did it to the echo of the crack of the ball and bat on the adjoining lot!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idx1qimoba7">In the evening when the other boys could sit by the lamp or study their lessons, we two boys went out with a basket and picked up wood and coal in the adjoining lots, or went after the dozen or so pieces of coal left from the ton of coal put in that afternoon by one of the neighbors, with the spot hungrily fixed in mind by one of us during the day, hoping that the man who carried in the coal might not be too careful in picking up the stray lumps!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idfvynq88l1">&#x201C;An experience that you know not of!&#x201D; Don&#x2019;t I?</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="idfjhq7tt8a">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="idgzb4vig9k">Our doubts are traitors, and make us lose the good we oft might win by fearing to attempt.</p><p class="Epigraph-SourceEpisrc" id="idu1dhbc8ip">&#x2014;Shakespeare</p><p class="ENDEND" id="id4t8fv9g2x">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idoymknxq1f">At ten years of age I got my first job, washing the windows of a baker&#x2019;s shop at fifty cents a week. In a week or two I was allowed to sell bread and cakes behind the counter after school hours for a dollar a week&#x2014;handing out freshly baked cakes and warm, delicious-smelling bread, when scarcely a crumb had passed my mouth that day!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idk5iy4cagc">Then on Saturday mornings I served a route for a weekly paper, and sold my remaining stock on the street. It meant from sixty to seventy cents for that day&#x2019;s work.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idpejgkiksp">I lived in Brooklyn, New York, and the chief means of transportation to Coney Island at that time was the horse car. Near where we lived the cars would stop to water the horses, the men would jump out and get a drink of water, but the women had no means of quenching their thirst. Seeing this lack I got a pail, filled it with water and a bit of ice, and, with a glass, jumped on each car on Saturday afternoon and all day Sunday, and sold my wares at a cent a glass. And when competition came, as it did very quickly when other boys saw that a Sunday&#x2019;s work meant two or three dollars, I squeezed a lemon or two in my pail, my liquid became &#x201C;lemonade&#x201D; and my price two cents a glass, and Sunday meant five dollars to me.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idq33v00w95">Then, in turn, I became a reporter during the evenings, an office boy day-times, and learned stenography at midnight.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idgku4xczfu">My correspondent says she supports her family of husband and child on eight hundred dollars a year, and says I have never known what that means. I supported a family of three on six dollars and twenty-five cents a week&#x2014;less than one-half of her yearly income. When my brother and I, combined, brought in eight hundred dollars a year we felt rich!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idzlwdxw0vg">I have for the first time gone into these details in print so that you may know, at first hand, that the editor of the <span class="itali">Ladies&#x2019;</span> <span class="itali">Home</span> <span class="itali">Journal</span> is not a theorist when he writes or prints articles that seek to preach economy or that reflect a hand-to-hand struggle on a small or an invisible income. There is not a single step, not an inch, on the road of direct poverty that I do not know of or have not experienced. And, having experienced every thought, every feeling and every hardship that come to those who travel that road, I say today that I rejoice with every boy who is going through the same experience.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idk55p6lnws">Nor am I discounting or forgetting one single pang of the keen hardships that such a struggle means. I would not today exchange my years of the keenest hardship that a boy can know or pass through for any single experience that could have come to me. I know what it means to earn&#x2014;not a dollar, but to earn two cents. I know the value of money as I could have learned it or known it in no other way. I could have been trained for my life-work in no surer way. I could not have arrived at a truer understanding of what it means to face a day without a penny in hand, not a loaf of bread in the cupboard, not a piece of kindling wood for the fire&#x2014;with nothing to eat, and then be a boy with the hunger of nine and ten, with a mother frail and discouraged!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idpf5ia51kz">&#x201C;An experience that you know not of!&#x201D; Don&#x2019;t I?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idhm8j4ww9d">And yet I rejoice in the experience, and I repeat: I envy every boy who is in that condition and going through it. But&#x2014;and here is the pivot of my strong belief in poverty as an undisguised blessing to a boy&#x2014;I believe in poverty as a condition to experience, to go through, and then to get out of: not as a condition to stay in. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s all very well,&#x201D; some will say; &#x201C;easy enough to say, but how can you get out of it?&#x201D; No one can definitely tell another that. No one told me. No two persons can find the same way out. Each must find his way for himself. That depends on the boy. I was determined to get out of poverty, because my mother was not born in it, could not stand it and did not belong in it. This gave me the first essential: a purpose. Then I backed up the purpose with effort and willingness to work and to work at anything that came my way, no matter what it was, so long as it meant &#x201C;the way out.&#x201D; I did not pick and choose; I took what came and did it in the best way I knew how; and when I didn&#x2019;t like what I was doing I still did it well while I was doing it, but I saw to it that I didn&#x2019;t do it any longer than I had to do it. I used every rung in the ladder as a rung to the one above. It meant effort, but out of the effort and the work came the experience; the upbuilding, the development; the capacity to understand and sympathize; the greatest heritage that can come to a boy. And nothing in the world can give that to a boy, so that it will burn into him, as will poverty.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idiib4lx9kz">That is why I believe so strongly in poverty, the greatest blessing in the way of the deepest and fullest experience that can come to a boy. But, as I repeat: always as a condition to work out of, not to stay in.</p><p class="Blank-Space-BreakBsbrk" id="idrykz7bdvc">[blank]</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2a692m9ox">Before you can develop the habit of perfect <span class="itali">self-control</span> you must understand the real need for this quality.

When you have mastered this simple law and learned how to use it you will have learned all that can be learned about salesmanship.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idzzc1656s9">The first and probably the most important step to be taken in mastering this law is to cultivate complete <span class="itali">self-control.</span> You must learn to take all sorts of punishment and abuse without retaliating in kind. This <span class="itali">self-control</span> is a part of the price you must pay for mastery of the Law of Retaliation.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idjjvwn3xu5">When an angry person starts in to vilify and abuse you, justly or unjustly, just remember that if you retaliate in a like manner you are being drawn down to that person&#x2019;s mental level, therefore <span class="itali">that</span> <span class="itali">person</span> <span class="itali">is</span> <span class="itali">dominating</span> <span class="itali">you!</span></p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="ide6eo3z97l">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="idyttzzn019">It is well worth remembering that the customer is the most important factor in any business.

Napoleon Junior had bought a bag of peanuts and James had bought a box of &#x201C;Crackerjack.&#x201D; James took a notion to sample the peanuts. Without asking permission he reached over and made a grab for the bag. He missed and Napoleon Junior &#x201C;retaliated&#x201D; with his left fist which landed rather briskly on James&#x2019; jaw.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idhw5q32fqu">I said to James: &#x201C;Now, see here, son, you didn&#x2019;t go about getting those peanuts in the right manner. Let me show you how to get them.&#x201D; It all happened so quickly that I hadn&#x2019;t the slightest idea when I spoke what I was going to suggest to James, but I sparred for time to analyze the occurrence and work out a better way, if possible, than that adopted by him.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idpcgzqc0hm">Then I thought of the experiments we had been making in connection with the Law of Retaliation, so I said to James: &#x201C;Open your box of &#x2018;Crackerjack&#x2019; and offer your little brother some and see what happens.&#x201D; After considerable coaxing I persuaded him to do this. Then a remarkable thing happened&#x2014;a happening out of which I learned my greatest lesson in salesmanship! <span class="itali">Before</span> <span class="itali">Napoleon</span> <span class="itali">would</span> <span class="itali">touch</span> <span class="itali">the</span> <span class="itali">&#x201C;Crackerjack&#x201D;</span> <span class="itali">he</span> <span class="itali">insisted</span> <span class="itali">on</span> <span class="itali">pouring</span> <span class="itali">some</span> <span class="itali">of</span> <span class="itali">his</span> <span class="itali">peanuts</span> <span class="itali">into</span> <span class="itali">James&#x2019;</span> <span class="itali">overcoat</span> <span class="itali">pocket.</span> He &#x201C;retaliated in kind!&#x201D; Out of this simple experiment with two small boys I learned more about the art of managing them than I could have learned in any other manner. Incidentally, my boys are beginning to learn how to manipulate this Law of Retaliation which saves them many a physical combat.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ids1rs0vl16">None of us have advanced far beyond Napoleon Junior and James as far as the operation and influence of the Law of Retaliation is concerned. We are all just grown-up children and easily influenced through this principle. The habit of &#x201C;retaliating in kind&#x201D; is so universally practiced among us that we can properly call this habit the Law of Retaliation. If a person presents us with a gift we never feel satisfied until we have &#x201C;retaliated&#x201D; with something as good or better than that which we received. If a person speaks well of us we increase our admiration for that person, and we &#x201C;retaliate&#x201D; in return!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idr2rfwhedr">Through the principle of retaliation we can actually convert our enemies into loyal friends. If you have an enemy whom you wish to convert into a friend you can prove the truth of this statement if you will forget that dangerous millstone hanging around your neck, which we call &#x201C;pride&#x201D; (stubbornness). Make a habit of speaking to this enemy with unusual cordiality. Go out of your way to favor him in every manner possible. He may seem immovable at first, but gradually he will give way to your influence and &#x201C;retaliate in kind!&#x201D; The hottest coals of fire ever heaped upon the head of one who has wronged you are the coals of human kindness.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idg2qd8xbvo">One morning in August, 1863, a young clergyman was called out of bed in a hotel at Lawrence, Kansas. The man who called him was one of Quantrell&#x2019;s guerrillas, and he wanted him to hurry downstairs and be shot. All over the border that morning people were being murdered. A band of raiders had ridden in early to perpetrate the Lawrence massacre.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idz8cd4ntkm">The guerrilla who called the clergyman was impatient. The latter, when fully awake, was horrified by what he saw going on through his window. As he came downstairs the guerrilla demanded his watch and money, and then wanted to know if he was an abolitionist. The clergyman was trembling. But he decided that if he was to die then and there it would not be with a lie on his lips. So he said that he was, and followed up the admission with a remark that immediately turned the whole affair into another channel.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idid8exygkl">He and the guerrilla sat down on the porch, while people were being killed through the town, and had a long talk. It lasted until the raiders were ready to leave. When the clergyman&#x2019;s guerrilla mounted to join his confederates he was strictly on the defensive. He handed back the New Englander&#x2019;s valuables, apologized for disturbing him and asked to be thought well of.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idizax7bz86">That clergyman lived many years after the Lawrence massacre. What did he say to the guerrilla? What was there in his personality that led the latter to sit down and talk? What did they talk about?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idszeon0qz3">&#x201C;Are you a Yankee abolitionist?&#x201D; the guerrilla had asked. &#x201C;Yes, I am,&#x201D; was the reply, &#x201C;and you know very well that you ought to be ashamed of what you&#x2019;re doing.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idlwx9xvqym">This drew the matter directly to a moral issue. It brought the guerrilla up roundly. The clergyman was only a stripling beside this seasoned border ruffian. But he threw a burden of moral proof on to the raider, and in a moment the latter was trying to demonstrate that he might be a better fellow than circumstances would seem to indicate.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idtwgc3et07">After waking this New Englander to kill him on account of his politics, he spent twenty minutes on the witness stand trying to prove an alibi. He went into his personal history at length. He explained matters from the time when he had been a tough little kid who wouldn&#x2019;t say his prayers, and became quite sentimental in recalling how one thing had led to another, and that to something worse, until&#x2014;well, here he was, and &#x201C;a mighty bad business to be in, pardner.&#x201D; His last request in riding away was: &#x201C;Now, pardner, don&#x2019;t think too hard of me, will you?&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id3wl02p0ca">The New England clergyman made use of the Law of Retaliation, whether he knew it at that time or not. Imagine what would have happened had he come downstairs with a revolver in his hand and started to meet physical force with physical force!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idrlx3jgzn7">But he didn&#x2019;t do this! He mastered the guerrilla because he fought him with a force that was unknown to the brigand.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ida9o4qiofl">Why is it that when once a man begins to make money the whole world seems to beat a pathway to his door?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2xvc2h5j6">Take any person that you know who enjoys financial success and he will tell you that he is being constantly sought, and that opportunities to make money are constantly being urged upon him!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idcjlp8fv69">&#x201C;To him that hath shall be given, but to him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id4sjefigrd">This quotation from the Bible used to seem ridiculous to me, yet how true it is when reduced to its concrete meaning.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id0n2fj013l">Yes, <span class="itali">&#x201C;to</span> <span class="itali">him</span> <span class="itali">that</span> <span class="itali">hath</span> <span class="itali">shall</span> <span class="itali">be</span> <span class="itali">given!&#x201D;</span> If he &#x201C;hath&#x201D; failure, lack of self-confidence, hatred or lack of <span class="itali">self-control,</span> to him shall these qualities be given in still greater abundance!

Life resembles a great kaleidoscope before which Time is ever shifting, changing and rearranging both the stage setting and the players. New friends are constantly replacing the old. Everything is in a state of flux. In every heart is the seed of both rascality and justice. Every human being is both a criminal and a saint, depending upon the expediency of the moment as to which will assert itself. Honesty and dishonesty are largely matters of individual viewpoint.

Remember, as you study this picture, that all these changes took place first in the minds of men.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2u77ny6qk">At the extreme left you see the first crude method of transportation. Man was <span class="itali">not</span> <span class="itali">satisfied</span> with this slow process. Those two little words &#x201C;not satisfied,&#x201D; have been the starting point of all advancement. Think of them as you read this article.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2wloj8zr3">Next, in the picture, you see the history of transportation step by step, as man&#x2019;s brain began to expand. It was a long step forward when man discovered how to hitch a bullock to a wagon and thereby escape the toil of pulling the load. That was practical utility. But, when the stage-coach was ushered into use that was both utility and style. Still man was &#x201C;not satisfied&#x201D; and this dissatisfaction created the crude locomotive that you see in the picture.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idcx1vqh6k3">Now all these methods of travel have been discarded except in certain uncivilized (or uncommercialized) parts of the world. The man drawing the cart, the bullock drawing the cart, the stage-coach and the crude locomotive all belong to ages that have passed.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idmpmm9jdxl">At the right you see the transportation methods of the present. Compare them with those of the past and you may have a fair idea of the enormous expansion that has taken place in the brain and mind of man. Man now moves about more rapidly than in the past. From the first type of locomotive there has been evolved a powerful machine capable of hauling a hundred cars of freight, compared with the one small, light car that could be drawn with the original. Automobiles that travel at the speed of seventy-five miles an hour are now as common as were the two-wheel carts in ages past. Moreover, they are within the means of all who want them.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idv0d5wiyro">And still man&#x2019;s mind was &#x201C;not satisfied.&#x201D; Travel on the earth was too slow. Turning his eyes upward he watched the birds soaring high in the elements and became &#x201C;DETERMINED&#x201D; to excel them. Study, also, the word &#x201C;determined,&#x201D; for whatever man becomes determined to do man does! Within the brief period of fifteen years man has mastered the air and now travels in the airplane at the rate of a hundred and fifty miles an hour.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idnz29tuc3u">Not only has man made the air carry him at amazingly rapid speed, but he has harnessed the ether and made it carry his words all the way around the earth in the fractional part of a second.</p><p class="Blank-Space-BreakBsbrk" id="idiej5sr0zi">[blank]</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idaxzlg6sgv">We have been describing the PAST and the PRESENT!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idu5zvnaw98">At the bottom of the picture we may see the next step forward that man will take in methods of travel; a machine that will fly in the air, run on the ground and swim in the water, at the discretion of man.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idzh96aj6d8">The purpose of this essay and the picture at the top of the page is to provide food for THOUGHT!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddlvhm622u">Any influence that causes one to think causes one, also, to grow stronger mentally. Mind stimulants are essential for growth. From the days of the man-drawn cart to the present days of air mastery the only progress that any man has made has been the result of some influence that stimulated his mind to greater than normal action.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id0we0nvvxf">The two great major influences that cause the mind of man to grow are the urge of necessity and the urge of desire to create. Some minds develop only after they have undergone failure and defeat and other forms of punishment which arouse them to greater action. Other minds wither away and die under punishment, but grow to unbelievable heights when provided with the opportunity to use their imaginative forces in a creative way.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idof1ahw3bb">Study the picture of the evolution of transportation and you will observe one outstanding fact worth remembering, namely, that the whole story has been one of development and advancement that grew out of <span class="itali">necessity.</span> The entire period described in the picture as &#x201C;THE PAST&#x201D; was one wherein the urge was that of necessity.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idxy52uk5e6">In the period described in the picture above as &#x201C;THE PRESENT&#x201D; the urge has been a combination of both necessity and the desire to create. The period described as &#x201C;THE FUTURE&#x201D; will be one in which the strong desire to create will be the sole urge that will drive man&#x2019;s mind on and on to heights as yet undreamed of.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idxnqtojcop">It is a long distance from the days of the man-drawn cart to the present, when man has harnessed the lightning of the clouds and made it turn machinery that will perform as much service in a minute as ten thousand men could perform in a day. But, if the distance has been long the development of man&#x2019;s mind has been correspondingly great, and that development has been sufficient to eventually do the work of the world with machines operated by Nature&#x2019;s forces and not by man&#x2019;s muscles.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2vu8qycv4">The evolutionary changes in the methods of transportation have created other problems for man&#x2019;s mind to solve. The automobile drove man to build better roads and more of them. The automobile and the speedy locomotive, combined, have created dangerous crossings which claim thousands of lives annually. Man&#x2019;s mind must now respond to the urge of &#x201C;necessity&#x201D; and meet this emergency.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idie65zqa7l">Keep this essay and remember this prophecy:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idpdr0lm62j">Within five years every railroad crossing in the country will be amply protected against automobile accidents, and, the automobile, itself, will manipulate the system that will do the protecting; a system that will be fool-proof and effective; a system that will work whether the driver of the automobile is asleep or awake, drunk or sober.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id935v88aly">Come, now, for a brief glimpse at the machinery of the imagination of man, as it works under the stimulant of desire to create.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2v18wfomz">Some imaginative man; perhaps some fellow who never did anything else of note and who will never do anything worthwhile again; will create a system of railroad crossing protection that will be operated by the weight of the passing automobile. Within the required distance from the crossing a platform similar to the platform of a large freight scale will cover an entire section of the roadway. As soon as an automobile mounts this platform the weight of the machine will lower a gate, ring a gong and flash a red light in front of the motorist. The gate will rise in one minute, allowing the motorist to pass over the track, thus forcing him to &#x201C;stop, look and listen.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id5szesy256">If you have a highly imaginative mind YOU may be the one who will create this system and collect the royalties from its sale.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idissss482w">To be practical the imaginative mind should be always on the alert for ways and means of diverting waste motion and power into useful channels. Most automobiles are far too heavy in comparison with the load they carry. This weight can be utilized by making it provide the motorist with railroad crossing protection.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idppjsmfguv">Remember, the purpose of this essay is to give you merely the seed of suggestion; not the finished product of an invention ready to set up and render service.

Each person did the work he liked best, or that for which he might be best equipped, and the products of their combined labors became the property of all. They had their own dairy, their own brick-making plant, their own cattle, poultry, etc. They had their own schools and a printing plant through which they published a paper.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idhlqkhaxo5">A Swedish gentleman from Minnesota joined the colony, and at his own request he was placed at work in the printing plant. Very soon he complained that he did not like the work, so he was changed and put to work on the farm, operating a tractor. Two days of this was all he could stand, so he again applied for a transfer, and was assigned to the dairy. He could not get along with the cows, so he was once more changed, to the laundry, where he lasted but one day. One by one he tried every job on the works, but liked none of them. It had begun to look as if he did not fit in with the co-operative idea of living, and he was about to withdraw when someone happened to think of one job he had not yet tried&#x2014;in the brick plant, so he was given a wheelbarrow and put to work wheeling bricks from the kilns and stacking them in piles, in the brick yard. A week&#x2019;s time went by and no complaint was registered by him. When asked if he liked his job he replied, &#x201C;This ban chust the job I like.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idtkw2fbr6h">Imagine anyone preferring a job wheeling bricks! However, that job suited the Swede&#x2019;s nature, he worked alone, at a task which called for no thought, and placed upon him no responsibility, which was just what he wanted.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idei592o3mz">He remained at the job until all the bricks had been wheeled out and stacked, then withdrew from the colony because there was no more brick work to be done. &#x201C;The nice quiet job ban finished, so I t&#x2019;ank I ban go back to Minney-so-tie,&#x201D; and back to &#x201C;Minney-so-tie&#x201D; he went!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idwyciu203z">When a man is engaged in work that he loves it is no hardship for him to do more work and better work than that for which he is paid, and for this very reason every man owes it to himself to do his best to find the sort of work he likes best.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idxjhkpe4xe">I have a perfect right to offer this advice to the students of this philosophy for the reason that I have followed it, myself, without reason to regret having done so.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9pc4s95ei">This seems to be an appropriate place to inject a little personal history concerning both the author and the Law of Success philosophy, the purpose of which is to show that labor performed in a spirit of love for the sake of the labor, itself, never has been and never will be lost.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id5vhgd8rga">This entire lesson is devoted to the offering of evidence that it really pays to render more service and better service than one is paid to render. What an empty and useless effort this would be if the author had not, himself, practiced this rule long enough to be able to say just how it works out.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id00xrsiupg">For over a quarter of a century I have been engaged in the labor of love out of which this philosophy has been developed, and I am perfectly sincere when I repeat that which I have stated elsewhere in this course, that I have been amply paid for my labors, by the pleasure I have had as I went along, even if I received nothing more.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idlw1fcchoc">My labors on this philosophy made it necessary, many years ago, for me to choose between immediate monetary returns, which I might have enjoyed by directing my efforts along purely commercial lines, and remuneration that comes in later years, and which is represented by both the usual financial standards and other forms of pay which can be measured only in terms of accumulated knowledge that enables one to enjoy the world about him more keenly.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idbz1z561e0">The man who engages in work that he loves best does not always have the support, in his choice, of his closest friends and relatives.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id07lod7kgv">Combating negative suggestions from friends and relatives has required an alarming proportion of my energies, during the years that I have been engaged in research work for the purpose of gathering, organizing, classifying and testing the material which has gone into this course.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idbnxdhgpoj">These personal references are made solely for the purpose of showing the students of this philosophy that seldom, if ever, can one hope to engage in the work one loves best without meeting with obstacles of some nature. Generally, the chief obstacles in the way of one engaging in the sort of work one loves best is that it may not be the work which brings the greatest remuneration at the start.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id41245chon">To offset this disadvantage, however, the one who engages in the sort of work he loves is generally rewarded with two very decided benefits, namely; first, he usually finds in such work the greatest of all rewards, HAPPINESS, which is priceless, and secondly, his actual reward in money, when averaged over a life-time of effort, is generally much greater, for the reason that labor which is performed in a spirit of love is usually greater in quantity and finer in quality than that which is performed solely for money.</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="idaisulskky">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="id1x9z1bagl">There is no more dangerous person&#x2014;dangerous to himself and to others&#x2014;than the person who passes judgment without pretending to know the facts.</p><p class="ENDEND" id="idt5f0rv2by">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id3up3snun2">The most embarrassing and, I might without any intention of disrespect say, the most disastrous opposition to my choice of a life-work came from my wife. This, perhaps, will explain why I have made frequent references, in many of the lessons of this course, to the fact that a man&#x2019;s wife may either &#x201C;make&#x201D; or &#x201C;break&#x201D; him, according to the extent to which she gives or withholds co-operation and encouragement in connection with his chosen work.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idz88wo7jr8">My wife&#x2019;s idea was that I should accept a salaried position that would insure a regular monthly income, because I had shown, by the few salaried positions I had held, that I had marketable ability which should command an income of from $6,000.00 to $10,000.00 a year without any very great effort on my part.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id72ae0kgoz">In a way I saw my wife&#x2019;s viewpoint and was in sympathy with it, because we had young growing children coming on who needed clothes and education, and a regular salary, even though it were not large, seemed to be a necessity.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idkud08e0u4">Despite this logical argument, however, I chose to override my wife&#x2019;s counsel. Came, then, to her rescue, the combined forces of her family and mine, and collectively they charged me, head-on, with what amounted to a command to right-about-face and settle down on a salary basis.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idjsxy2cyn8">Studying other people might be all right for a man who had the time to spend in this &#x201C;unprofitable&#x201D; manner, they reasoned, but for a young married man with a growing family this seemed hardly the thing to do.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idunsdieyv3">But I remained adamant! I had made my choice and I was determined to stand by it.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9euux62d1">The opposition did not yield to my viewpoint, but gradually, of course, it melted away. Meanwhile, the knowledge that my choice had worked at least a temporary hardship on my family, combined with the thought that my dearest friends and relatives were not in harmony with me, greatly increased my labors.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1oqi4w6rf">Fortunately, not all of my friends believed my choice unwise!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9swok1pm4">There were a few friends who not only believed I was following a course that would ultimately bring me out somewhere near the top of the mountain of useful achievement, but, in addition to believing in my plans, they actually went out of their way to encourage me not to be whipped by either adversity or the opposition of relatives.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idnrkspi7h8">Of this small group of faithful ones who gave me encouragement at a time when it was badly needed, perhaps one man should have the fullest credit, and this man is Edwin C. Barnes, a business associate of Thomas A. Edison.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id03h1uqzab">Mr. Barnes became interested in my chosen work nearly twenty years ago, and I owe it to him to state here that had it not been for his unwavering faith in the soundness of the Law of Success philosophy I would have yielded to the persuasion of my friends and sought the way of least resistance via the salary route.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idbefwka6tx">This would have saved me much grief and an almost endless amount of criticism, but it would have wrecked the hopes of a life-time, and in the end I would in all probability have lost, also, the finest and most desirable of all things, HAPPINESS! for I have been extremely happy in my work, even during the periods when the remuneration it brought me could be measured by nothing but a mountain of debts which I could not for the moment pay.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9ijm3gwl4">Perhaps this may explain, to some extent, why the subject of slavery through debt was so extensively emphasized in Lesson Three, on the Habit of Saving.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id8x10wbgkn">We want that lesson to &#x201C;sink in.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ids9oyjfgtq">Edwin Barnes not only believed in the soundness of the Law of Success philosophy, but his own financial success had demonstrated, as had also his close business relationship with the greatest inventor on earth, that he had the right to speak with authority on the subject of the laws through which success may be achieved.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9oxv7cv8u">I began my work of research with the belief that success could be attained, by anyone with reasonable intelligence and a real desire to succeed, by following certain (then by me unknown) rules of procedure. I wanted to know what these rules were and how they could be applied.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idtatsawnrl">Mr. Barnes believed as I did. Moreover, he was in a position to know that the astounding achievements of his business associate, Mr. Edison, came about entirely through the application of some of the principles which later were tested and included as a part of this philosophy. From his way of thinking it seemed that the accumulation of money, enjoying peace of mind and finding happiness could be brought about by the application of never-varying laws which anyone might master and apply.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2rgp3xf6f">That was my belief, also. That belief has now been transformed into not merely a provable, but a PROVED reality, as I hope every student of this course will have reason to understand when the course shall have been mastered.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id8yb1y1lf9">Please keep in mind that during all these years of research I was not only applying the law covered by this lesson, by DOING MORE THAN PAID FOR, but, I was going much further than this by doing work for which I did not, at the time I was doing it, hope ever to receive pay.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id934tk8a34">Thus, out of years of chaos, adversity and opposition this philosophy was finally completed and reduced to manuscripts, ready for publication.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idnk7s4nu1j">For a time nothing happened!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idbi6tepz63">I was resting on my oars, so to speak, before taking the next step toward placing the philosophy in the hands of people who I had reason to believe would welcome it.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id3buc0dq8x">&#x201C;God moves in a mysterious way, His wonders to perform!&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idzseb15fac">During the earlier years of my experience I thought these words to be empty and meaningless, but I have since modified my belief considerably.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ide5xia7war">I was invited to deliver an address in Canton, Ohio. My coming had been well advertised and there was reason to expect that I would have a large audience. To the contrary, conflicting meetings being held by two large groups of business men reduced my audience to the lucky number of &#x201C;thirteen.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2dut6ianz">It has always been my belief that a man should do his best, regardless of how much he receives for his services, or the number of people he may be serving or the class of people served. I went at my subject as though the hall were filled. Somehow there arose in me a sort of feeling of resentment on account of the way the &#x201C;wheel of fate&#x201D; had turned against me, and if I ever made a convincing speech I made it that night.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9691klmpk">Down deep in my heart, however, I thought I had failed!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idh6cvics6z">I did not know until the next day that I was making history the night before that was destined to give the Law of Success philosophy its first real impetus.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id7qwypd25o">One of the men who sat in my audience, as one of the &#x201C;thirteen,&#x201D; was the late Don R. Mellett, who was then the publisher of the Canton <span class="itali">Daily</span> <span class="itali">News,</span> brief reference to whom I made in the Introduction to this course.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idm78kaneli">After I had finished speaking I slipped out at the back door and returned to my hotel, not wanting to face any of my &#x201C;thirteen&#x201D; victims on the way out.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idppy1jp8cx">The next day I was invited to Mr. Mellett&#x2019;s office.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idbautihwvl">Inasmuch as it was he who had taken the initiative by inviting me in to see him I left it to him to do most of the talking. He began in something like this fashion:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idpb7amhgkn">&#x201C;Would you mind telling me your entire life-story, from the days of your early childhood on up to the present?&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ide7mxvco84">I told him I would do so if he could stand the burden of listening to so long a narrative. He said he could, but before I began he cautioned me not to omit the unfavorable side.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idtuvi07w7s">&#x201C;What I wish you to do,&#x201D; said he, &#x201C;is to mix the fat with the lean and let me take a look at your very soul, not from its most favorable side, but from all sides.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idogll8xuiq">For three hours I talked while Mellett listened!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idg2l7teqoe">I omitted nothing. I told him of my struggles, of my mistakes, of my impulses to be dishonest when the tides of fortune swept against me too swiftly, and of my better judgment which prevailed in the end, but only after my conscience and I had engaged in prolonged combat. I told him how I conceived the idea of organizing the Law of Success philosophy, how I had gone about gathering the data that had gone into the philosophy, of the tests I had made which resulted in the elimination of some of the data and the retention of other parts of it.</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="idor8txvvty">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="idi2gvno47w">Among the other things you intend to &#x201C;cut out&#x201D; in your New Year&#x2019;s resolution, include the word &#x201C;Impossible!&#x201D;</p><p class="ENDEND" id="id8116t4yo6">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ide5fbt5m6t">After I had finished Mellett said: &#x201C;I wish to ask you a very personal question, and I hope you will answer it as frankly as you have told the remainder of your story. Have you accumulated any money from your efforts, and, if not, do you know why you have not?&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idy9xgj20j6">&#x201C;No!&#x201D; I replied. &#x201C;I have accumulated nothing but experience and knowledge and a few debts, and the reason, while it may not be sound, is easily explained. The truth is that I have been so busy all these years in trying to eliminate some of my own ignorance so I could intelligently gather and organize the data that have gone into the Law of Success philosophy, that I have had neither the opportunity nor the inclination to turn my efforts to making money.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idecjlnzxh8">The serious look on Don Mellett&#x2019;s face, much to my surprise, softened into a smile as he laid his hand on my shoulder and said:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idu7zg0q1f3">&#x201C;I knew the answer before you stated it, but I wondered if you knew it. You probably know that you are not the only man who has had to sacrifice immediate monetary remuneration for the sake of gathering knowledge, for in truth your experience has been that of every philosopher from the time of Socrates down to the present.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iduhlw26p8n">Those words fell as the sound of music upon my ears!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idciya1d0ki">I had made one of the most embarrassing admissions of my life; I had laid my soul bare, admitting temporary defeat at almost every cross-road which I had passed in my struggles, and I had capped all this off by admitting that an exponent of the Law of Success was, himself, a temporary failure!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idecm95r55r">How incongruous it seemed! I felt stupid, humiliated and embarrassed as I sat in front of the most searching pair of eyes and the most inquisitive man I had ever met.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id6d98vu9uc">The absurdity of it all came over me like a flash&#x2014;THE PHILOSOPHY OF SUCCESS CREATED AND BROADCASTED BY A MAN WHO WAS OBVIOUSLY A FAILURE!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iditp7rg0ke">This thought struck me so forcibly that I expressed it in words.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ids0mr239u2">&#x201C;What?&#x201D; Mellett exclaimed, &#x201C;a failure?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idiik5l26ta">&#x201C;Surely you know the difference between failure and temporary defeat,&#x201D; he continued. &#x201C;No man is a failure who creates a single idea, much less an entire philosophy, that serves to soften the disappointments and minimize the hardships of generations yet unborn.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id602ajikqb">I wondered what was the object of this interview. My first conjecture was that Mellett wanted some facts on which to base an attack, in his newspaper, on the Law of Success philosophy. Perhaps this thought grew out of some of my previous experiences with newspaper men, a few of whom had been antagonistic toward me. At any rate, I decided at the outset of the interview to give him the facts, without embellishment, come from it what would.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idu6ysdyg5p">Before I left Mellett&#x2019;s office we had become business partners, with the understanding that he would resign as publisher of the Canton <span class="itali">Daily</span> <span class="itali">News</span> and take over the management of all my affairs, as soon as this could be arranged.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idinrwitcm5">Meanwhile, I began writing a series of Sunday feature-page editorials which were published in the Canton <span class="itali">Daily</span> <span class="itali">News,</span> based upon the Law of Success philosophy.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idays9e6rhl">One of these editorials (the one entitled &#x201C;Failure,&#x201D; which appears in the back of one of the lessons of this course) came to the attention of Judge Elbert H. Gary, who was at that time the Chairman of the Board of the United States Steel Corporation. This resulted in the opening of communication between Mellett and Judge Gary, which, in turn, led to Judge Gary&#x2019;s offer to purchase the Law of Success course for the use of the employees of the Steel Corporation, in the manner described in the Introduction.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idafsdefwc1">The tides of fortune had begun to turn in my favor!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idkzpm4dnab">The seeds of service which I had been sowing over a long period of toilsome years, by DOING MORE THAN PAID FOR, were beginning to germinate at last!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id377dnkgyx">Despite the fact that my partner was assassinated before our plans had much more than started, and Judge Gary died before the Law of Success philosophy could be re-written so it conformed to his requirements, the &#x201C;love&#x2019;s labor lost&#x201D; on that fateful night, when I spoke to an audience of thirteen in Canton, Ohio, started a chain of events which now move rapidly without thought or effort on my part.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idbms5ery58">It is no abuse of confidences to enumerate here a few of the events which show that no labor of love is ever performed at a total loss, and that those who render more service and better service than that for which they are paid sooner or later receive pay for much more than they actually do.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddoo6q1s6y">As this lesson is ready to go to the publisher some of the following well known concerns are considering favorably the purchase of the Law of Success course for all their employees, while others have actually arranged for the purchase of the course:</p><p class="Unnum-Level-1-ListUl1" id="idpf7zxhc8d">Mr. Daniel Willard, President of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Co.</p><p class="Unnum-Level-1-ListUl1" id="idgqtr56g0h">Indian Refining Company</p><p class="Unnum-Level-1-ListUl1" id="id9tz4ppxnz">Standard Oil Company</p><p class="Unnum-Level-1-ListUl1" id="idodm2uxrye">New York Life Insurance Company</p><p class="Unnum-Level-1-ListUl1" id="id6kyu4o1cv">The Postal Telegraph Commercial-Cable Company</p><p class="Unnum-Level-1-ListUl1" id="id88xns17ae">The Pierce-Arrow Motor Car Company</p><p class="Unnum-Level-1-ListUl1" id="idyuzf8zhff">The Cadillac Motor Car Company</p><p class="Unnum-Level-1-ListUl1" id="idw29bseahf">And some fifty other concerns of a similar size.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idai5yck4dt">In addition to this, a newly organized club for boys, similar in nature to the Y. M. C.

How many courses they will distribute cannot be accurately estimated, but when one stops to consider the fact that they have a mailing list of approximately 800,000 people who have faith in anything they offer for sale, it seems very reasonable to suppose that their distribution will place tens of thousands of courses in the hands of men and women who are earnestly searching for the knowledge conveyed by the Law of Success philosophy.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idqjj9p0k8p">Perhaps it is unnecessary, but I wish to explain that my only object in here relating the story of how the Law of Success philosophy has gained the recognition described is to show how the law upon which this lesson is based actually works out in the practical affairs of life.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idqozjgihns">If I could have made this analysis without the use of the personal pronoun I would have done so.</p><p class="Blank-Space-BreakBsbrk" id="idqmsqd3j3b">[blank]</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idbewcw35ox">With this background of history concerning the Law of Success philosophy as a whole, and this lesson in particular, you are better prepared to accept as sound the law on which this lesson is based.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2q2xv3540">There are more than a score of sound reasons why you should develop the habit of performing more service and <span class="itali">better</span> <span class="itali">service</span> than that for which you are paid, despite the fact that a large majority of the people are not rendering such service.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddqt7yzmo3">There are two reasons, however, for rendering such service, which transcend, in importance, all the others; namely,</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="idzx8vdxlw1">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="idmvu2j3pr5">If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.</p><p class="ENDEND" id="id8tsntfcl9">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id0xoxdbuoq"><span class="itali">First:</span> By establishing a reputation as being a person who always renders more service and better service than that for which you are paid, you will benefit by comparison with those around you who do not render such service, and the contrast will be so noticeable that <span class="itali">there</span> <span class="itali">will</span> <span class="itali">be</span> <span class="itali">keen</span> <span class="itali">competition</span> <span class="itali">for</span> <span class="itali">your</span> <span class="itali">services,</span> <span class="itali">no</span> <span class="itali">matter</span> <span class="itali">what</span> <span class="itali">your</span> <span class="itali">life-work</span> <span class="itali">may</span> <span class="itali">be.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idr5nbncn46">It would be an insult to your intelligence to offer proof of the soundness of this statement, because it is obviously sound. Whether you are preaching sermons, practicing law, writing books, teaching school, or digging ditches, you will become more valuable and you will be able to command greater pay the minute you gain recognition as a person who does more than that for which he is paid.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idwmd6ywmh0"><span class="itali">Second:</span> By far the most important reason why you should render more service than that for which you are paid; a reason that is basic and fundamental in nature; may be described in this way: Suppose that you wished to develop a strong right arm, and suppose that you tried to do so by tying the arm to your side with a rope, thus taking it out of use and giving it a long rest. Would disuse bring strength, or would it bring atrophy and weakness, resulting, finally, in your being compelled to have the arm removed?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idjl61nen4s">You know that if you wished a strong right arm you could develop such an arm <span class="itali">only</span> <span class="itali">by</span> <span class="itali">giving</span> <span class="itali">it</span> <span class="itali">the</span> <span class="itali">hardest</span> <span class="itali">sort</span> <span class="itali">of</span> <span class="itali">use.</span> Take a look at the arm of a blacksmith if you wish to know how an arm may be made strong. Out of resistance comes strength. The strongest oak tree of the forest is not the one that is protected from the storm and hidden from the sun, but it is the one that stands in the open, where it is compelled to struggle for its existence against the winds and rains and the scorching sun.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddv410l2uu">It is through the operation of one of Nature&#x2019;s unvarying laws that struggle and resistance develop strength, and the purpose of this lesson is to show you how to harness this law and so use it that it will aid you in your struggle for success. By performing more service and better service than that for which you are paid, you not only exercise your service-rendering qualities, and thereby develop skill and ability of an extraordinary sort, but you build reputation that is valuable. If you form the habit of rendering such service you will become so adept in your work that you can <span class="itali">command</span> greater remuneration than those who do not perform such service. You will eventually develop sufficient strength to enable you to remove yourself from any undesirable station in life, and no one can or will desire to stop you.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idyrj4mdaee">If you are an employee you can make yourself so valuable, through this habit of performing more service than that for which you are paid, that you can practically set your own wages and no sensible employer will try to stop you. If your employer should be so unfortunate as to try to withhold from you the compensation to which you are entitled, this will not long remain as a handicap because other employers will discover this unusual quality and offer you employment.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id5ogvlhtd8">The very fact that most people are rendering as little service as they can possibly get by with serves as an advantage to all who are rendering more service than that for which they are paid, because it enables all who do this to profit by comparison. You can &#x201C;get by&#x201D; if you render as little service as possible, but that is all you will get; and when work is slack and retrenchment sets in, you will be one of the first to be dismissed.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idgvmojptzm">For more than twenty-five years I have carefully studied men with the object of ascertaining why some achieve noteworthy success while others with just as much ability do not get ahead; and it seems significant that every person whom I have observed applying this principle of rendering more service than that for which he was paid, was holding a better position and receiving more pay than those who merely performed sufficient service to &#x201C;get by&#x201D; with.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idoft2pqka7"><span class="itali">Personally</span> <span class="itali">I</span> <span class="itali">never</span> <span class="itali">received</span> <span class="itali">a</span> <span class="itali">promotion</span> <span class="itali">in</span> <span class="itali">my</span> <span class="itali">life</span> <span class="itali">that</span> <span class="itali">I</span> <span class="itali">could</span> <span class="itali">not</span> <span class="itali">trace</span> <span class="itali">directly</span> <span class="itali">to</span> <span class="itali">recognition</span> <span class="itali">that</span> <span class="itali">I</span> <span class="itali">had</span> <span class="itali">gained</span> <span class="itali">by</span> <span class="itali">rendering</span> <span class="itali">more</span> <span class="itali">service</span> <span class="itali">and</span> <span class="itali">better</span> <span class="itali">service</span> <span class="itali">than</span> <span class="itali">that</span> <span class="itali">for</span> <span class="itali">which</span> <span class="itali">I</span> <span class="itali">was</span> <span class="itali">paid.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id7373fhzci">I am stressing the importance of making this principle a habit as a means of enabling an employee to promote himself to a higher position, with greater pay, for the reason that this course will be studied by thousands of young men and young women who work for others. However, the principle applies to the employer or to the professional man or woman just the same as to the employee.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id98994y2ns">Observance of this principle brings a two-fold reward. First, it brings the reward of greater material gain than that enjoyed by those who do not observe it; and, second, it brings that reward of happiness and satisfaction which come only to those who render such service. If you receive no pay except that which comes in your pay envelope, you are underpaid, no matter how much money that envelope contains.</p><p class="Blank-Space-BreakBsbrk" id="idy8zt0o2qp">[blank]</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idysrk2ktop">My wife has just returned from the Public Library with a book for me to read.

I have, also, sound reason to believe that this policy enabled Ford to reduce the cost of supervision, because employment in his plant became so desirable that no worker would care to run the risk of losing his position by &#x201C;soldiering&#x201D; on the job or rendering poor service.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idurhpbidqe">Where other employers were forced to depend upon costly supervision in order to get the service to which they were entitled, and for which they were paying, Ford got the same or better service by the less expensive method of placing a premium upon employment in his plant.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idh59tq87st">Marshall Field was probably the leading merchant of his time, and the great Field store, in Chicago, stands today as a monument to his ability to apply the Law of Increasing Returns.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idoyrgxbas5">A customer purchased an expensive lace waist at the Field store, but did not wear it. Two years later she gave it to her niece as a wedding present. The niece quietly returned the waist to the Field store and exchanged it for other merchandise, despite the fact that it had been out for more than two years and was then out of style.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idy4fv6zclt">Not only did the Field store take back the waist, but, what is of more importance it did so <span class="itali">without</span> <span class="itali">argument!</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idxlj8h0e36">Of course there was no obligation, moral or legal, on the part of the store to accept the return of the waist at that late date, which makes the transaction all the more significant.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9wkd2gq0v">The waist was originally priced at fifty dollars, and of course it had to be thrown on the bargain counter and sold for whatever it would bring, but the keen student of human nature will understand that the Field store not only did not lose anything on the waist, but it actually profited by the transaction to an extent that cannot be measured in mere dollars.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddnephzc72">The woman who returned the waist knew that she was not entitled to a rebate; therefore, when the store gave her that to which she was not entitled the transaction won her as a permanent customer. But the effect of the transaction did not end here; it only began; for this woman spread the news of the &#x201C;fair treatment&#x201D; she had received at the Field store, far and near. It was the talk of the women of her set for many days, and the Field store received more advertising from the transaction than it could have purchased in any other way with ten times the value of the waist.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idahfp4dqnf">The success of the Field store was built largely upon Marshall Field&#x2019;s understanding of the Law of Increasing Returns, which prompted him to adopt, as a part of his business policy, the slogan, &#x201C;The customer is always right.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idnu2y14ulz">When you do only that for which you are paid, there is nothing out of the ordinary to <span class="itali">attract</span> <span class="itali">favorable</span> <span class="itali">comment</span> about the transaction; but, when you willingly do more than that for which you are paid, your action attracts the favorable attention of all who are affected by the transaction, and goes another step toward establishing a reputation that will eventually set the Law of Increasing Returns to work in your behalf, for this reputation will create a demand for your services, far and wide.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idn5h69z0yi">Carol Downes went to work for W.C.

The wise man always throws himself on the side of his assailants. It is more his interest than it is theirs to find his weak point. Blame is safer than praise. I hate to be defended in a newspaper. As long as all that is said is said against me, I feel a certain assurance of success. But as soon as honeyed words of praise are spoken of me, I feel as one that lies unprotected before his enemies.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id223v62hi6">Study this, the philosophy of the immortal Emerson, for it may serve as a modifying force that will temper your metal and prepare you for the battles of life, as carbon tempers the steel.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id92zfhlp6h">If you are a very young person, you need to study it all the more, for it often requires the stern realities of many years of experience to prepare one to assimilate and apply this philosophy.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id8ywwb2p2r">Better that you should understand these great truths as a result of my undiplomatic presentation of them than to be forced to gather them from the less sympathetic sources of cold experience. Experience is a teacher that knows no favorites. When I permit you to profit by the truths I have gathered from the teachings of this cold and unsympathetic teacher called &#x201C;experience,&#x201D; I am doing my best to show you favoritism, which reminds me, somewhat, of the times when my father used to &#x201C;do his duty&#x201D; by me, in the woodshed, always starting with this bit of encouraging philosophy:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idpv0ng968x">&#x201C;Son, this hurts me worse than it does you.&#x201D;</p><p class="Blank-Space-BreakBsbrk" id="idbz4e3tlrp">[blank]</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id6f04srty1">Thus we approach the close of this lesson without having exhausted the possibilities of the subject; nay, without having more than scratched the surface of it.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id7dautmzba">There comes to my mind the story of a romance of long ago through which I can leave in your mind the main import of this lesson. This story had its setting in the city of Antioch, in ancient Rome, two thousand years ago, when the great city of Jerusalem and all the land of Judea were under the oppressive heel of Rome.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idzx37qknqj">The star figure of the story was a young Jew by the name of Ben Hur, who was falsely accused of crime and sentenced to hard labor, at the galley&#x2019;s oar. Chained to a bench in the galley, and being forced to tug wearily at the oars, Ben Hur developed a powerful body. Little did his tormentors know that out of his punishment would grow the strength with which he would one day gain his freedom. Perhaps Ben Hur, himself, had no such hopes.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idnw93vk0pi">Then came the day of the chariot races: the day that was destined to break the chains that bound Ben Hur to the oars of the galley and give him his freedom.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddtan1uvr2">One span of horses was without a driver. In desperation the owner sought the aid of the young slave because of his mighty arms, and begged him to take the place of the missing driver.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idbhysxs28c">As Ben Hur picked up the reins, a mighty cry went up from the onlookers.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2th492g1f">&#x201C;Look! Look! Those arms!&#x2014;where did you get them?&#x201D; they howled, and Ben Hur answered:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idujkvhr5k2">&#x201C;At the galley&#x2019;s oar!&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idbw0t2ipdp">The race was on.

It was he who brought together the point of a needle and a piece of wax in such a way that they record and preserve the human voice. It was he who first made the lightning serve to light our houses and streets, through the aid of the incandescent light. It was he who made the camera record and produce all sorts of motion, through the modern moving picture apparatus.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idobrzuv5st">Mr. Firestone&#x2019;s industrial achievement is so well known that it needs no comment.

It was one of those contagious smiles, because I caught the spirit of it and began to smile also.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idt6bw8qew6">As I reached the railing the old lady extended her hand to shake hands with me. Now, as a rule, I do not become too friendly on first acquaintance when a person calls at my office, for the reason that it is very hard to say &#x201C;no&#x201D; if the caller should ask me to do that which I do not wish to do.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id0dk0gqbar">However, this dear old lady looked so sweetly innocent and harmless that I extended my hand and <span class="itali">she</span> <span class="itali">began</span> <span class="itali">to</span> <span class="itali">shake</span> <span class="itali">it!</span> whereupon, I discovered that she not only had an attractive smile, but she also had a magnetic hand-shake. She took hold of my hand firmly, but not too firmly, and the very manner in which she went about it telegraphed the thought to my brain that it <span class="itali">was</span> <span class="itali">she</span> who was doing the honors. She made me feel that she was really and truly <span class="itali">glad</span> to shake my hand, and I believe that she was. I believe that her hand-shake came from the heart as well as from the hand.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idghikasu2r">I have shaken hands with many thousands of people during my public career, but I do not recall having ever done so with anyone who understood the art of doing it as well as this old lady did. The moment she touched my hand I could feel myself &#x201C;slipping,&#x201D; and I knew that whatever it was that she had come after she would go away with it, and that I would aid and abet her all I could toward this end.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idlo4obeba2">In other words, that penetrating smile and that warm hand-shake had disarmed me and made me a &#x201C;willing victim.&#x201D; At a single stroke this old lady had shorn me of that false shell into which I crawl when salesmen come around selling, or <span class="itali">trying</span> <span class="itali">to</span> <span class="itali">sell,</span> that which I do not want. To go back to an expression which you found quite frequently in previous lessons of this course, this gentle visitor had &#x201C;neutralized&#x201D; my mind and made me want to listen.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idgjjo9eu24">Ah, but here is the stumbling point at which most salespeople fall and break their necks, figuratively speaking, for it is as useless to try to sell a man something until you have first made him <span class="itali">want</span> to listen, as it would be to command the earth to stop rotating.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idut06nrslp">Note well how this old lady used a smile and a hand-shake as the tools with which to pry open the window that led to my heart; but the most important part of the transaction is yet to be related.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddmovgc37h">Slowly and deliberately, as if she had all the time there was in the universe (which she did have, as far as I was concerned at that moment) the old lady began to crystallize the first step of her victory into reality by saying:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idlslzgyxeb"><span class="itali">&#x201C;I</span> <span class="itali">just</span> <span class="itali">came</span> <span class="itali">here</span> <span class="itali">to</span> <span class="itali">tell</span> <span class="itali">you</span> (what seemed to me to be a long pause) <span class="itali">that</span> <span class="itali">I</span> <span class="itali">think</span> <span class="itali">you</span> <span class="itali">are</span> <span class="itali">doing</span> <span class="itali">the</span> <span class="itali">most</span> <span class="itali">wonderful</span> <span class="itali">work</span> <span class="itali">of</span> <span class="itali">any</span> <span class="itali">man</span> <span class="itali">in</span> <span class="itali">the</span> <span class="itali">world</span> <span class="itali">today.&#x201D;</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idbtc5ie799">Every word was emphasized by a gentle, though firm, squeeze of my hand, and <span class="itali">she</span> <span class="itali">was</span> <span class="itali">looking</span> <span class="itali">through</span> <span class="itali">my</span> <span class="itali">eyes</span> <span class="itali">and</span> <span class="itali">into</span> <span class="itali">my</span> <span class="itali">heart</span> <span class="itali">as</span> <span class="itali">she</span> <span class="itali">spoke.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id6pfgsnbro">After I regained consciousness (for it became a standing joke among my assistants at the office that I fainted dead away) I reached down and unlocked the little secret latch that fastened the gate and said:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id5w5agqjmq"><span class="itali">&#x201C;Come</span> <span class="itali">right</span> <span class="itali">in,</span> <span class="itali">dear</span> <span class="itali">lady,&#x2014;come</span> <span class="itali">right</span> <span class="itali">into</span> <span class="itali">my</span> <span class="itali">private</span> <span class="itali">office,&#x201D;</span> and with a gallant bow that would have done credit to the cavaliers of olden times, I bade her come in and &#x201C;sit awhile.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idb0nhdc1vb">As she entered my private office, I motioned her to the big easy-chair back of my desk while I took the little hard-seated chair which, under ordinary circumstances, I would have used as a means of discouraging her from taking up too much of my time.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id7y062oog5">For three-quarters of an hour I listened to one of the most brilliant and charming conversations I have ever heard, and my visitor was doing <span class="itali">all</span> of the conversing. From the very start she had assumed the initiative and taken the lead, and, up to the end of that first three-quarters of an hour, she found no inclination, on my part, to challenge her right to it.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9m0unpu0w">I repeat, lest you did not get the full import of it, that I was <span class="itali">a</span> <span class="itali">willing</span> <span class="itali">listener!</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idt4rj5fvcr">Now comes the part of the story which would make me blush with embarrassment, if it were not for the fact that you and I are separated by the pages of this book; but I must summon the courage with which to tell you the facts because the entire incident would lose its significance if I failed to do this.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idykrp6ndm1">As I have stated, my visitor entranced me with brilliant and captivating conversation for three-quarters of an hour. Now, what do you suppose she was talking about all that time?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idod5pmduyi"><span class="itali">No!</span> You are wrong.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9bxdaikmr">She was not trying to sell me a book, nor did she once use the personal pronoun &#x201C;I.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idg9ajpppsm">However, she was not only <span class="itali">trying,</span> but actually <span class="itali">selling</span> me something, and <span class="itali">that</span> <span class="itali">something</span> <span class="itali">was</span> <span class="itali">myself.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idpxbgc6p26">She had no sooner been seated in that big cushioned chair than she unrolled a package which I had mistaken for a book that she had come to sell me, and sure enough, there was a book in the package&#x2014;in fact, several of them; for she had a complete year&#x2019;s file of the magazine of which I was then editor (<span class="itali">Hill&#x2019;s</span> <span class="itali">Golden</span> <span class="itali">Rule</span>). She turned the pages of those magazines and read places that she had marked here and there, assuring me, in the meanwhile, that <span class="itali">she</span> <span class="itali">had</span> <span class="itali">always</span> <span class="itali">believed</span> <span class="itali">the</span> <span class="itali">philosophy</span> <span class="itali">back</span> <span class="itali">of</span> <span class="itali">that</span> <span class="itali">which</span> <span class="itali">she</span> <span class="itali">was</span> <span class="itali">reading.</span></p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="idt7skpwc7l">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="idjp3l7tehn">If you have tried and met with defeat; if you have planned and watched your plans as they were crushed before your eyes; just remember that the greatest men in all history were the products of courage, and courage, you know, is born in the cradle of adversity.</p><p class="ENDEND" id="ids8mh1vv9k">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idevqvk2bw8">Then, after I was in a state of complete mesmerism, and thoroughly receptive, my visitor tactfully switched the conversation to a subject which, I suspect, she had in mind to discuss with me long before she presented herself at my office; but&#x2014;<span class="itali">and</span> <span class="itali">this</span> <span class="itali">is</span> <span class="itali">another</span> <span class="itali">point</span> <span class="itali">at</span> <span class="itali">which</span> <span class="itali">most</span> <span class="itali">salespeople</span> <span class="itali">blunder</span>&#x2014;had she reversed the order of her conversation and begun where she finished, the chances are that she never would have had the opportunity to sit in that big easy-chair.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idrxssxvj2n">During the last three minutes of her visit, she skillfully laid before me the merits of some securities that she was selling. She did not ask me to purchase; but, the way in which she told me of the merits of the securities (plus the way in which she had so impressively told me of the merits of my own &#x201C;game&#x201D;) had the psychological effect of causing me to want to purchase; and, even though I made no purchase of securities from her, she <span class="itali">made</span> <span class="itali">a</span> <span class="itali">sale</span>&#x2014;because I picked up the telephone and introduced her to a man to whom she later sold more than five times the amount that she had intended selling me.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idzoux1dm25">If that same woman, or another woman, or a man, who had the tact and <span class="itali">personality</span> that she possessed, should call on me, I would again sit down and listen for three-quarters of an hour.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idg57vbtrsx">We are all human; and we are all more or less vain!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idwr4t9h4oq">We are all alike in this respect&#x2014;we will listen with intense interest to those who have the tact to talk to us about that which lies closest to our hearts; and then, out of a sense of reciprocity, we will also listen with interest when the speaker finally switches the conversation to the subject which lies closest to his or her heart; and, at the end, we will not only &#x201C;sign on the dotted line&#x201D; but we will say, <span class="itali">&#x201C;What</span> <span class="itali">a</span> <span class="itali">wonderful</span> <span class="itali">personality!&#x201D;</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id00vss5wx8">In the city of Chicago, some years ago, I was conducting a school of salesmanship for a securities house which employed more than fifteen hundred salespeople. To keep the ranks of that big organization filled, we had to train and employ six hundred new salespeople every week. Of all the thousands of men and women who went through that school, there was but one man who grasped the significance of the principle I am here describing, the first time he heard it analyzed.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idfoo7q5egx">This man had never tried to sell securities and frankly admitted, when he entered the salesmanship class, that he was not a salesman. Let&#x2019;s see whether he was or not.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idbvwdbs3cl">After he had finished his training, one of the &#x201C;star&#x201D; salesmen took a notion to play a practical joke on him, believing him to be a credulous person who would believe all that he heard, so this &#x201C;star&#x201D; gave him an inside &#x201C;tip&#x201D; as to where he would be able to sell some securities without any great effort. This star would make the sale himself, so he said; but the man to whom he referred as being a likely purchaser was an ordinary artist who would purchase with so little urging that he, being a &#x201C;star,&#x201D; did not wish to waste his time on him.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idayp49f3fc">The newly made salesman was delighted to receive the &#x201C;tip,&#x201D; and, forthwith, he was on his way to make the sale. As soon as he was out of the office, the &#x201C;star&#x201D; gathered the other &#x201C;stars&#x201D; around him and told of the joke he was playing; for in reality the artist was a very wealthy man and the &#x201C;star,&#x201D; himself, had spent nearly a month trying to sell him, but without success. It then developed that all of the &#x201C;stars&#x201D; of that particular group had called on this same artist but had failed to interest him.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idfrdjhoj5g">The newly made salesman was gone about an hour and a half. When he returned he found the &#x201C;stars&#x201D; waiting for him with smiles on their faces.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id8y3eucexg">To their surprise, the newly made salesman also wore a broad smile on his face. The &#x201C;stars&#x201D; looked at each other inquiringly, for they had expected that this &#x201C;green&#x201D; man would not return in a joyful mood.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9wx7mnpmt">&#x201C;Well, did you sell to your man?&#x201D; inquired the originator of this &#x201C;joke.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ida7n1u5zwy">&#x201C;Certainly,&#x201D; replied the uninitiated one, &#x201C;and I found that artist to be all you said he was&#x2014;a perfect gentleman and a very interesting man.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idlrbv3vfx9">Reaching into his pocket he pulled out an order and a check for $2,000.00.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idfgzxzybkn">The &#x201C;stars&#x201D; wanted to know how he did it.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idh0x41tr82">&#x201C;Oh, it wasn&#x2019;t difficult,&#x201D; replied the newly made salesman; &#x201C;I just walked in and talked to him a few minutes and he brought up the subject of the securities himself, and said he wanted to purchase; therefore, I really did not sell to him&#x2014;he purchased of his own accord.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idy3gvsq6px">When I heard of the transaction, I called the newly made salesman in and asked him to describe, in detail, just how he made the sale, and I will relate it just as he told it.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id62uzgcekx">When he reached the artist&#x2019;s studio, he found him at work on a picture. So engaged in his work was the artist that he did not see the salesman enter; so the salesman walked over to where he could see the picture and stood there looking at it without saying a word.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddyhr57mrp">Finally the artist saw him; then the salesman apologized for the intrusion and began to talk&#x2014;<span class="itali">about</span> <span class="itali">the</span> <span class="itali">picture</span> <span class="itali">that</span> <span class="itali">the</span> <span class="itali">artist</span> <span class="itali">was</span> <span class="itali">painting!</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idbvvuhf4kr">He knew just enough about art to be able to discuss the merits of the picture with some intelligence; and he was really interested in the subject.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idoawt1dact">He liked the picture and frankly told the artist so, which, of course, <span class="itali">made</span> <span class="itali">the</span> <span class="itali">artist</span> <span class="itali">very</span> <span class="itali">angry!</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idpzo64ddhq">For nearly an hour those two men talked of nothing but art; particularly that picture that stood on the artist&#x2019;s easel.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idhu7bfqydm">Finally, the artist asked the salesman his name and his business, and the <span class="itali">salesman</span> (yes, the <span class="itali">master</span> salesman) replied, &#x201C;Oh, never mind my business or my name; I am more interested in <span class="itali">you</span> <span class="itali">and</span> <span class="itali">your</span> <span class="itali">art!&#x201D;</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id05hmza6ri">The artist&#x2019;s face beamed with a smile of joy.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idaknqnps4l">Those words fell as sweet music upon his ears. But, not to be outdone by his polite visitor, he insisted on knowing what mission had brought him to his studio.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idkw1aprp7i">Then, with an air of genuine reluctance, this <span class="itali">master</span> <span class="itali">salesman&#x2014;</span>this real &#x201C;star&#x201D;&#x2014;introduced himself and told his business.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id7t2ohqsep">Briefly he described the securities he was selling, and the artist <span class="itali">listened</span> <span class="itali">as</span> <span class="itali">if</span> <span class="itali">he</span> <span class="itali">enjoyed</span> <span class="itali">every</span> <span class="itali">word</span> <span class="itali">that</span> <span class="itali">was</span> <span class="itali">spoken.</span> After the salesman had finished the artist said:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idusrwo87xt">&#x201C;Well, well!

The question most often asked, however, is, &#x201C;How can I learn to create ideas that will earn money?&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idoduwodvf1">In part we will answer this question in this lesson by suggesting some new and novel ideas, any of which might be developed and made very profitable, by almost anyone, in practically any locality.</p><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="idn1xnmc6mk">Idea Number One</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idezcgo5pxt">The world war has deprived Germany of her enormous trade in toys. Before the war we bought most of our toys from Germany. We are not likely to buy any more toys from German manufacturers in our time, or for a long while afterward.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idt11v6d9cs">Toys are in demand, not alone in the United States, but in foreign countries, many of which will not buy toys from Germany. Our only competitor is Japan and her toys are of so poor a quality that her competition means nothing.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idkj2ewe4qw">But what sort of toys shall I manufacture and where will I get the capital with which to carry on the business, you will ask?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idd0gg1azvg">First, go to a local toy dealer and find out just which class of toys sells most rapidly. If you do not feel competent to make improvements on some of the toys now on the market, advertise for an inventor &#x201C;with an idea for a marketable toy&#x201D; and you will soon find the mechanical genius who will supply this missing link in your undertaking. Have him make you a working model of just what you want, then go to some small manufacturer, woodworker, machine shop or the like, and arrange to have your toys manufactured.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idn5v6mrk3c">You now know just what your toy will cost, so you are ready to go to some big jobber, wholesaler or distributor and arrange for the sale of your entire product.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1pl0vc7l0">If you are an able salesman you can finance this whole project on the few dollars required with which to advertise for the inventor. When you find this man you can probably arrange with him to work out a model for you during his spare evening hours, with a promise that you will give him a better job when you are manufacturing your own toys. He will probably give you all the time you want in which to pay him for his labor; or he may do the work in return for an interest in the business.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idr56xb6oyd">You can get the manufacturer of your toys to wait for his money until you are paid by the firm to which you sell them; and, if necessary, you can assign to him the invoices for the toys sold and let the money come direct to him.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idmvoxc1had">Of course if you have an unusually pleasing and convincing personality and considerable ability to organize, you will be able to take the working model of your toy to some man of means and, in return for an interest in the business, secure the capital with which to do your own manufacturing.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idx8irkw2fz">If you want to know what will sell, watch a crowd of children at play, study their likes and dislikes, find out what will amuse them and you will probably get an idea on which to build your toy. It requires no genius to invent! Common sense is all that is necessary. Simply find out what the people want and then produce it. Produce it well&#x2014;better than anyone else is doing. Give it a touch of individuality. Make it distinctive.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id3v5oqwa6z">We spend millions of dollars annually for toys with which to entertain our children. Make your new toy useful as well as interesting. Make it educational if possible. If it entertains and teaches at the same time it will sell readily and live forever. If your toy is in the nature of a game make it teach the child something about the world in which it lives, geography, arithmetic, English, physiology, etc. Or, better still, produce a toy that will cause the child to run, jump or in some other way exercise. Children love to move about and moving about is of benefit to them, especially when stimulated by the play motive.</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="id5vkv9hjj9">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="idixnzvjm0g">It is better to be a big man in a small town than to be a small man in a big town, and ever so much easier.</p><p class="ENDEND" id="idqgs415joo">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iduryrilfa8">An indoor baseball game would be a ready seller, especially in the cities. Work out an arrangement for attaching the ball to a string that will be suspended from the ceiling so one child may throw the ball against the wall and then stand back and strike it with a bat as it rebounds. A one-child baseball game, in other words.</p><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="idp9aumvnu0">Plan Number Two</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id70we5ck11">This will be of interest only to the man or woman who has the self-confidence and the ambition to &#x201C;run the risk&#x201D; of making a big income, which, we may add, most people have not.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ideea6yy34g">It is a suggestion that could be put into practical operation by at least forty or fifty people in every large city throughout the United States, and by a smaller number in the smaller cities.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idt4j1hleb1">It is intended for the man or woman who can write or will learn to write advertising copy, sales literature, follow-up letters, collection letters and the like, using the ability to write which we will suppose that you possess.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idsdlrkro1c">To make practical and profitable use of this suggestion you will need the co-operation of a good advertising agency and from one to five firms or individuals who do enough advertising to warrant their appropriations going through an agency.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9juryq7jl">You should go to the agency first and make arrangements with it to employ you and pay you seven per cent on the gross expenditures of all accounts which you bring to it; this seven per cent to compensate you for getting the account and for writing the copy and otherwise serving the client in the management of his advertising appropriation. Any reliable agency will gladly give you this amount for all the business you will bring.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9xv24wbua">Then you go to a firm or individual whose advertising account you wish to handle and say in effect that you wish to go to work <span class="itali">without</span> <span class="itali">compensation.</span> Tell what you can do and what you intend to do for that particular firm that will help it sell more goods. If the firm employs an advertising manager you are to become virtually his assistant <span class="itali">without</span> <span class="itali">pay,</span> on one condition, namely, that the advertising appropriation is to be placed through the agency with which you have the connection. Through this arrangement the firm or individual whose account you thus secure will get the benefit of your personal services, <span class="itali">without</span> <span class="itali">cost,</span> and pay no more for placing its advertising through your agency than it would through any other. If your canvass is convincing and you really take the time to prepare your case, you will get your account without much argument.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idxt49b69ea">You can repeat this transaction until you have as many accounts as you can handle advantageously, which, under ordinary conditions, will be not more than ten or twelve; probably less if one or more of your clients spends upwards of $25,000.00 a year in advertising.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id0flfcjt93">If you are a competent writer of advertising copy and have the ability to create new and profitable ideas for your clients you will be able to hold their business from year to year. You of course understand that you are not to accept more accounts than you can handle individually. You should spend a portion of your time in the place of business of each of your clients; in fact you should have a desk and working equipment right on the grounds, so you can get first-hand information as to your clients&#x2019; sales problems as well as accurate information as to their goods and wares.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idmbqvqt8hs">Through this sort of effort you will give the advertising agency a reputation for effective service such as it would get in no other way, and you will please your clients because they will see satisfactory returns from your efforts. As long as you keep the agency and the clients whom you serve satisfied your job is safe and you will make money. A reasonable expectation of returns under this plan would be a gross business of $250,000.00 a year, on which your seven per cent would amount to $17,500.00.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idts6rpfokk">A man or woman of unusual ability could run the figure much higher than this, up to, say, an income of $25,000.00 a year, while the tendency would be, however, to drop down to around $5,000.00 to $7,500.00, which are the figures that the &#x201C;average&#x201D; man or woman might reasonably expect to earn.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idlwyxqvbkf">You can see that the plan has possibilities. It supplies independent work and gives you one hundred per cent of your earning power. It is better than a position as advertising manager, even if the position paid the same money, because it practically places you in a business of your own&#x2014;one in which your name is constantly developing a survival value.</p><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="idktfluuhx4">Plan Number Three</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idb84k6toaa">This plan can be put into operation by almost any man or woman of average intelligence, and with but little preparation. Go to any first-class printer and make arrangements with him to handle all the business you bring to him, allowing you a commission of say ten per cent on the gross amount. Then go to the largest users of printed matter and get samples of everything in the way of printing that they use.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idje4s8p992">Form a partnership or working arrangement with a commercial artist who will go over all this printed matter and wherever suitable or appropriate he will improve the illustrations or make illustrations where none were used before, making a rough pencil sketch which can be pasted to the original printed matter.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9r0ew8o55">Then, if you are not a writer of copy, form a working arrangement with someone who is and get him or her to go over the copy of the printed matter and improve it in every respect possible.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ide0rogoqb3">When the work is complete go back to the firm from whom you get the printed matter, taking with you quotations on the work and show what can be done in the way of improvement. Say nothing about your quotations, however, until you have shown how much you could improve the printed matter. You will probably get the entire business of that firm by giving that sort of service in connection with every job of printing it has done.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idum4p9a3av">If you perform your service properly you will soon have all the business that your commercial artist, your copy writer and you can handle. It ought to be good for $5,000.00 a year apiece for you.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idobutb6kte">Any profits that you earn from the work of others in connection with any of these plans will be a legitimate profit&#x2014;a profit to which you will be entitled in return for your ability to organize and bring together the necessary talent and ability with which to perform satisfactory service.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idwt8aut9wv">If you go into the toy business you will be entitled to a profit on the work of those who make the toys because it will be through your ability that employment for them is available.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id4a1oy3r52">It is more than likely that your brains and your ability, when added to that of those who work with you or for you, will greatly increase their earning capacity&#x2014;even to the extent that they can well afford to see you make a small amount from their efforts <span class="itali">because</span> <span class="itali">they</span> <span class="itali">will</span> <span class="itali">be</span> <span class="itali">still</span> <span class="itali">earning</span> <span class="itali">much</span> <span class="itali">more</span> <span class="itali">than</span> <span class="itali">they</span> <span class="itali">could</span> <span class="itali">earn</span> <span class="itali">without</span> <span class="itali">your</span> <span class="itali">guidance!</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id5tj2xvj4d">You are willing to take any of these plans and make a profit out of them, are you not? You see nothing wrong on your part, do you? If you are an employee, working for some other person or firm, may it not be possible that the head of that firm or that individual, with his ability to organize, finance, etc., is increasing your own earning capacity right now?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idxujxnh8fm">You want to get out of the employee class and become an employer. We do not blame you for that. Nearly every normal person wants to do the same. The one best first step to take is to serve the firm or individual for whom you are working just as you would wish to be served if you were that individual or the head of that firm.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idi3gzlujbw">Who are the big employers of help, today? Are they the rich men&#x2019;s sons who fell heir to employership? Not on your life! They are the men and women who came up from the ranks of the most lowly sort of labor; men and women who have had no greater opportunity than you have. They are in the positions that they hold because their superior ability has enabled them intelligently to direct others. You can acquire that ability if you will try.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idjqo8f1c2n">Right in the town or city where you live there are people who probably could benefit by knowing you, and who could undoubtedly benefit you in return. In one section of the city lives John Smith who wishes to sell his grocery store and open a moving picture theater. In another section of the city is a man who has a moving picture theater that he would like to trade for a grocery store.</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="id036znrzma">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="idxfmmvp7dw">Aspiration is greater than realization, because it keeps us eternally climbing upward toward some unattained goal.</p><p class="ENDEND" id="id9hhuc1tgc">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id58o40wxpu">Can you bring them together?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idep03cr8oh">If you can, you will serve both and earn a nice remuneration.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idxvdwm4mpf">In your town or city are people who want the products raised on the farms in the surrounding community. On those farms are farmers who raise farm products and who want to get them into the hands of those who live in town. If you can find a way of carrying the farm products direct from the farm to the city or town consumer you will enable the farmer to get more for his products and the consumer to get those products for less, and still there will be a margin to pay you for your ingenuity in shortening the route between producer and consumer.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id3tatwngbd">In business there are, broadly speaking, two classes of people&#x2014;the Producers and the Consumers. The tendency of the times is to find some way of bringing these two together without so many intermediaries. Find a way to shorten the route between producer and consumer and you will have created a plan that will help these two classes and handsomely profit you.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idmcfy58j25">The laborer is worthy of his hire. If you can create such a plan you are entitled to a fair proportion of that which you <span class="itali">save</span> for the consumer and also a fair proportion of that which you <span class="itali">make</span> for the producer.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idhpotk0duq">Let us warn you that whatever plan you create as a means of making money you had better see that it slices off a little of the cost to the consumer instead of adding a little to that cost.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idvx117bvll">The business of bringing producer and consumer together is a profitable business when it is conducted fairly to both, and without a greedy desire to <span class="itali">get</span> <span class="itali">all</span> <span class="itali">there</span> <span class="itali">is</span> <span class="itali">in</span> <span class="itali">sight!</span> The American public is wonderfully patient with profiteers who impose upon it, but there is a pivotal point beyond which even the shrewdest of them dare not go.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idne1s01ocs">It may be all right to corner the diamond market and run up enormously high the price of those white rocks which are dug out of the ground in Africa without trouble, but when the prices of food and clothing and other necessities begin to soar skyward there is a chance of someone getting into the bad graces of the American public.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idhfxqtkzk2">If you crave wealth and are really brave enough to shoulder the burdens which go with it, reverse the usual method of acquiring it by giving your goods and wares to the world at the lowest possible profit you can afford instead of exacting all that you can with safety. Ford has found it profitable to pay his workers, <span class="itali">not</span> <span class="itali">as</span> <span class="itali">little</span> <span class="itali">as</span> <span class="itali">he</span> <span class="itali">can</span> <span class="itali">get</span> <span class="itali">them</span> <span class="itali">for,</span> <span class="itali">but</span> <span class="itali">as</span> <span class="itali">much</span> <span class="itali">as</span> <span class="itali">his</span> <span class="itali">profits</span> <span class="itali">will</span> <span class="itali">permit.</span> He has also found it profitable to reduce the price of his automobile to the consumer while other manufacturers (many of whom have long since failed) continued to increase their price.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idtrgezcppg">There may be some perfectly good plans through the operation of which you could squeeze the consumer and still manage to keep out of jail, but you will enjoy much more peace of mind and in all probability more profits in the long run if your plan, when you complete it, is built along the Ford lines.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id84n73h14w">You have heard John D. Rockefeller abused considerably, but most of this abuse has been prompted by sheer envy upon the part of those who would like to have his money but who haven&#x2019;t the inclination to earn it. Regardless of your opinion of Rockefeller, do not forget that he began as a humble bookkeeper and that he gradually climbed to the top in the accumulation of money because of his ability to organize and direct other and less able men intelligently. This author can remember when he had to pay twenty-five cents for a gallon of lamp oil and walk two miles through the hot sun and carry it home in a tin can in the bargain. Now, Rockefeller&#x2019;s wagon will deliver it at the back door, in the city or on the farm, at a little over half that sum.</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="idqm3djl2es">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="idxwkzrrtq8">Congratulate yourself when you reach that degree of wisdom which prompts you to see less of the weaknesses of others and more of your own, for you will then be walking in the company of the really great.</p><p class="ENDEND" id="idemc7ituau">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id4lus65ze0">Who has a right to begrudge Rockefeller his millions as long as he has reduced the price of a needed commodity.

While Mark Antony displayed evidence of great self-control in being able to assume, at the beginning of his speech, an attitude toward Brutus that was not real, at the same time it is obvious that his entire appeal was based upon his knowledge of how to influence the minds of the Roman mob, through flattery.</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="idunvdobvrf">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="idxq4rwc9x2">I have great wealth that can never be taken away from me; that I can never squander; that cannot be lost by declining stocks or bad investments; I have the wealth of contentment with my lot in life.</p><p class="ENDEND" id="id9wyytw3yj">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ids0o3m03yc">The two letters reproduced in Lesson Six, of this course, illustrate, in a very concrete way the value of the <span class="itali">&#x201C;you&#x201D;</span> and the fatality of the <span class="itali">&#x201C;I&#x201D;</span> appeal. Go back and read these letters again and observe how the more successful of the two follows closely the Mark Antony appeal, while the other one is based upon an appeal of just the opposite nature. Whether you are writing a sales letter, or preaching a sermon or writing an advertisement, or a book, you will do well to follow the same principles employed by Mark Antony in his famous speech.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ide3xkzj4lj">Now let us turn our attention to the study of ways and means through which one may develop a <span class="itali">pleasing</span> <span class="itali">personality.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idoyvzro8ol">Let us start with the first essential, which is <span class="itali">character,</span> for no one may have a <span class="itali">pleasing</span> <span class="itali">personality</span> without the foundation of a sound, positive character. Through the principle of telepathy you &#x201C;telegraph&#x201D; the nature of your character to those with whom you come in contact, which is responsible for what you have often called an &#x201C;intuitive&#x201D; feeling that the person whom you had just met, but about whom you did not know very much, was not trustworthy.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id3zv99e4u6">You may embellish yourself with clothes of the neatest and latest design, and conduct yourself in a most pleasing manner as far as outside appearances go; but if there is greed, and envy, and hatred, and jealousy, and avarice, and selfishness in your heart, you will never <span class="itali">attract</span> any, except those characters which harmonize with your own. Like attracts like, and you may be sure, therefore, that those who are attracted to you are those whose inward natures parallel your own.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idfwvr013c2">You may embellish yourself with an artificial smile that belies your feelings, and you may practice the art of hand-shaking so that you can imitate, perfectly, the hand-shake of the person who is an adept at this art, but, if these outward manifestations of an <span class="itali">attractive</span> <span class="itali">personality</span> lack that vital factor called <span class="itali">earnestness</span> <span class="itali">of</span> <span class="itali">purpose</span> they will repel instead of attract.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idspqcc7xx5">How, then, may one build <span class="itali">character?</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iduhph97gq7">The first step in <span class="itali">character</span> building is rigid <span class="itali">self-discipline:</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idsd1g8hztd">In both the first and seventh lessons of this course, you will find the formula through which you may shape your <span class="itali">character</span> after any pattern that you choose; but I repeat it here, as it is based upon a principle that will bear much repetition, as follows:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idljvhurnt2"><span class="itali">First:</span> Select those whose characters were made up of the qualities which you wish to build into your own character, and then proceed, in the manner described in Lesson One, to appropriate these qualities, through the aid of <span class="itali">Auto-suggestion.</span> Create, in your imagination, a council table and gather your characters around it each night, first having written out a clear, concise statement of the particular qualities that you wish to appropriate from each. Then proceed to affirm or suggest to yourself, in outspoken, audible words, that you are developing the desired qualities in yourself. As you do this close your eyes and see, in your imagination, the figures seated around your imaginary table, in the manner described in Lesson One.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idl6jrq3a56"><span class="itali">Second:</span> Through the principles described in Lesson Seven, on <span class="itali">Self-control,</span> control your thoughts and keep your mind vitalized with thoughts of a positive nature. Let the dominating thought of your mind be a picture of the person that you intend to be: the person <span class="itali">that</span> <span class="itali">you</span> <span class="itali">are</span> <span class="itali">deliberately</span> <span class="itali">building,</span> through this procedure. At least a dozen times a day, when you have a few minutes to yourself, shut your eyes and direct your thoughts to the figures which you have selected to sit at your imaginary council table; and feel, with a <span class="itali">faith</span> that knows <span class="itali">NO</span> <span class="itali">LIMITATION,</span> that you are actually growing to resemble in character those figures of your choice.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idv683v4grj"><span class="itali">Third:</span> Find at least one person each day, and more if possible, in whom you see some good quality that is worthy of praise, and <span class="itali">praise</span> <span class="itali">it.</span> Remember, however, that this praise must not be in the nature of cheap, insincere flattery; it must be genuine. Speak your words of praise with such earnestness that they will impress those to whom you speak; then watch what happens. You will have rendered those whom you praise a decided benefit of great value to them; and, you will have gone just one more step in the direction of developing the habit of looking for and finding the good qualities in others. I cannot overemphasize the far-reaching effects of this habit of praising, openly and enthusiastically, the good qualities in others; for this habit will soon reward you with a feeling of self-respect and manifestation of gratitude from others, that will modify your entire personality. Here, again, the law of attraction enters, and those whom you praise will see, in you, the qualities that you see in them. Your success in the application of this formula will be in exact proportion to your <span class="itali">faith</span> in its soundness.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idup4koj5rs">I do not merely believe that it is sound&#x2014;<span class="itali">I</span> <span class="itali">know</span> <span class="itali">that</span> <span class="itali">it</span> <span class="itali">is&#x2014;</span>and the reason <span class="itali">I</span> <span class="itali">know</span> is that I have used it successfully and I have also taught others how to use it successfully; therefore, I have a right to promise you that you can use it with equal success.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idna8s9bwfm">Furthermore, you can, with the aid of this formula, develop an <span class="itali">attractive</span> <span class="itali">personality</span> so speedily that you will surprise all who know you. The development of such a personality is entirely within your own control, a fact which gives you a tremendous advantage and at the same time places upon you the responsibility if you fail or neglect to exercise your privilege.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ideeayusqsk">I now wish to direct your attention to the reason for speaking, aloud, the affirmation that you are developing the desired qualities which you have selected as the materials out of which to develop an <span class="itali">attractive</span> <span class="itali">personality.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idx5gr8lllj">This procedure has two desirable effects; namely&#x2014;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idbws94t96k"><span class="itali">First:</span> It sets into motion the vibration through which the thought back of your words reaches and imbeds itself in your sub-conscious mind, where it takes root and grows until it becomes a great moving force in your outward, physical activities, leading in the direction of transformation of the thought into reality.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1xhr7l1n0"><span class="itali">Second:</span> It develops in you the ability to speak with force and conviction which will lead, finally, to great ability as a public speaker. No matter what your calling in life may be, you should be able to stand upon your feet and speak convincingly, as this is one of the most effective ways of developing an <span class="itali">attractive</span> <span class="itali">personality.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9t27lbv8g">Put feeling and emotion into your words as you speak, and develop a deep, rich tone of voice. If your voice is inclined to be high pitched, tone it down until it is soft and pleasing. You can never express an <span class="itali">attractive</span> <span class="itali">personality,</span> to best advantage, through a harsh or shrill voice. You must cultivate your voice until it becomes rhythmical and pleasing to the ear.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idb3sqgpyj6">Remember that speech is the chief method of expressing your personality, and for this reason it is to your advantage to cultivate a style that is both forceful and pleasing.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idg8u6yil0h">I do not recall a single outstanding <span class="itali">attractive</span> <span class="itali">personality</span> that was not made up, in part, of ability to speak with force and conviction. Study the prominent men and women of today, wherever you find them, and observe the significant fact that the more prominent they are the more efficient are they in speaking forcefully.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id030ru8bnv">Study the outstanding figures of the past in politics and statesmanship and observe that the most successful ones were those who were noted for their ability to speak with force and conviction.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idxd8c59ka3">In the field of business, industry and finance it seems significant, also, that the most prominent leaders are men and women who are able public speakers.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idssxrqrwmb">In fact no one may hope to become a prominent leader in any noteworthy undertaking without developing the ability to speak with forcefulness that carries conviction. While the salesman may never deliver a public address, he will profit, nevertheless, if he develops the ability to do so, because this ability increases his power to talk convincingly in ordinary conversation.</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="id89m01wzps">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="idj36teob26">Enthusiasm is the mainspring of the soul.

First, to think accurately you must separate <span class="itali">facts</span> from mere <span class="itali">information.</span> There is much &#x201C;information&#x201D; available to you that is not based upon facts. Second, you must separate <span class="itali">facts</span> into two classes; namely, the <span class="itali">important</span> and the <span class="itali">unimportant,</span> or, the <span class="itali">relevant</span> and the <span class="itali">irrelevant.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id6vzvcl07c">Only by so doing can you think clearly.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idrrozuzvo1">All <span class="itali">facts</span> which you can use in the attainment of your <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">chief</span> <span class="itali">aim</span> are important and relevant; all that you cannot use are unimportant and irrelevant. It is mainly the neglect of some to make this distinction which accounts for the chasm which separates so widely people who appear to have equal ability, and who have had equal opportunity. Without going outside of your own circle of acquaintances you can point to one or more persons who have had no greater opportunity than you have had, and who appear to have no more, and perhaps less, ability than you, who are achieving far greater success.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idrgtygmajy">And you wonder why!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idp0b2d3xnw">Search diligently and you will discover that all such people have acquired the habit of combining and using the <span class="itali">important</span> <span class="itali">facts</span> which affect their line of work. Far from working harder than you, they are perhaps working less and with greater ease. By virtue of their having learned the secret of separating the <span class="itali">important</span> <span class="itali">facts</span> from the <span class="itali">unimportant,</span> they have provided themselves with a sort of fulcrum and lever with which they can move with their little fingers loads that you cannot budge with the entire weight of your body.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idd7ord26bv">The person who forms the habit of directing his attention to the <span class="itali">important</span> <span class="itali">facts</span> out of which he is constructing his Temple of Success, thereby provides himself with a power which may be likened to a trip-hammer which strikes a ten-ton blow as compared to a tack-hammer which strikes a one-pound blow!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idac7l6yqt2">If these similes appear to be elementary you must keep in mind the fact that some of the students of this course have not yet developed the capacity to think in more complicated terms, and to try to force them to do so would be the equivalent of leaving them hopelessly behind.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id0rko26n49">That you may understand the importance of distinguishing between <span class="itali">facts</span> and mere <span class="itali">information,</span> study that type of man who is guided entirely by that which he hears; the type who is influenced by all the &#x201C;whisperings of the winds of gossip&#x201D;; that accepts, without analysis, all that he reads in the newspapers and judges others by what their enemies and competitors and contemporaries say about them.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idqk3hqgu8y">Search your circle of acquaintances and pick out one of this type as an example to keep before your mind while we are on this subject.

The moment a man begins to make himself felt in the field of industry or business, this chorus becomes active. If a man makes a better mouse-trap than his neighbor, the world will make a beaten path to his door; no doubt about that; and in the gang that will trail along will be those who come, not to commend, but to condemn and to destroy his reputation. The late John H.

Here we find life in a still higher and more intelligent form, with ability to move from place to place.</p><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idf9uwq4mwb"><span class="boldb">4. </span>Then comes the Human or Thinking Man Period, where we find life in its highest known form; the highest, because man can <span class="itali">think,</span> and because <span class="itali">thought</span> is the highest known form of organized energy. In the realm of <span class="itali">thought</span> man knows no limitations. He can send his <span class="itali">thoughts</span> to the stars with the quickness of a flash of lightning. He can gather facts and assemble them in new and varying combinations. He can create hypotheses and translate them into physical reality, through <span class="itali">thought.</span> He can reason both inductively and deductively.</p><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idfk70bbmeh"><span class="boldb">5. </span>Then comes the Spiritual Period. On this plane the lower forms of life, described in the previously mentioned four periods, converge and become infinitude in nature.

You can see why one must search diligently for <span class="itali">facts,</span> and why one cannot afford to lend a receptive ear to the slanderer and the scandalmonger&#x2014;for to do so is the equivalent of feeding the subconscious mind with food that is poison and ruinous to <span class="itali">creative</span> <span class="itali">thought.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idt7cjemsma">The sub-conscious mind may be likened to the sensitive plate of a camera on which the picture of any object placed before the camera will be recorded.

The conscious mind may be likened to the shutter which shuts off the light from the sensitized plate, permitting nothing to reach the plate for record except that which the operator wishes to reach it. The lens of the camera may be likened to Autosuggestion, for it is the medium which carries the image of the object to be registered, to the sensitized plate of the camera. And <span class="itali">infinite</span> <span class="itali">intelligence</span> may be likened to the one who develops the sensitized plate, after a picture has been recorded on it, thus bringing the picture into physical reality.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idiemk2zljw">The ordinary camera is a splendid instrument with which to compare the whole process of <span class="itali">creative</span> <span class="itali">thought.</span> First comes the selection of the object to be exposed before the camera. This represents one&#x2019;s <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">chief</span> <span class="itali">aim</span> in life. Then comes the actual operation of recording a clear outline of that <span class="itali">purpose,</span> through the lens of Auto-suggestion, on the sensitized plate of the sub-conscious mind. Here <span class="itali">infinite</span> <span class="itali">intelligence</span> steps in and develops the outline of that <span class="itali">purpose</span> in a physical form appropriate to the nature of the <span class="itali">purpose.</span> The part which <span class="itali">you</span> must play is clear!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ide82xzc8ur">You select the picture to be recorded <span class="itali">(definite</span> <span class="itali">chief</span> <span class="itali">aim).</span> Then you fix your conscious mind upon this purpose with such intensity that it communicates with the sub-conscious mind, through Auto-suggestion, and registers that picture.

Then comes a period of waiting and working for the realization of the object of that <span class="itali">purpose.</span> During this period, there must be continuous, intensified <span class="itali">faith,</span> which serves as the sunshine and the rain, without which the seed will wither and die in the ground.

However, as the evolutionary process carries on its work (and it will do so; make no mistake about this) all the principles described in this and in all other lessons of this course, will become as familiar to you as did the multiplication table after you had mastered it; and, what is of greater importance still, these principles will work with the same unvarying certainty as does the principle of multiplication.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idwxdegdmu2">Each lesson of this course has provided you with <span class="itali">definite</span> instructions to follow. The instructions have been simplified as far as possible, so anyone can understand them. Nothing has been left to the student except to follow the instructions and supply the <span class="itali">faith</span> in their soundness without which they would be useless.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1hu86vqql">In this lesson you are dealing with four major factors to which I would again direct your attention with the request that you familiarize yourself with them. They are:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idrfpruk44e">Auto-suggestion, the Sub-conscious Mind, Creative Thought and Infinite Intelligence.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idr18res6dg">These are the four roadways over which you must travel in your upward climb in quest of knowledge. Observe that <span class="itali">you</span> control three of these. Observe, also&#x2014;and this is especially emphasized&#x2014;that upon the manner in which you traverse these three roadways will depend the <span class="itali">time</span> and <span class="itali">place</span> at which they will converge into the fourth, or <span class="itali">infinite</span> <span class="itali">intelligence.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2d1ub4aic">You understand what is meant by the terms Auto-suggestion and Sub-conscious Mind. Let us make sure that you understand, also, what is meant by the term Creative Thought. This means <span class="itali">thought</span> of a positive, non-destructive, creative nature. The object of Lesson Seven, on Self-control, was to prepare you to understand and successfully apply the principle of Creative Thought. If you have not mastered that lesson you are not ready to make use of Creative Thought in the attainment of your <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">chief</span> <span class="itali">aim.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idnh0a2vj9l">Let me repeat a simile already used by saying that your sub-conscious mind is the field or the soil in which you sow the seed of your <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">chief</span> <span class="itali">aim.</span> Creative Thought is the instrument with which you keep that soil fertilized and conditioned to awaken that seed into growth and maturity. Your sub-conscious mind will not germinate the seed of your <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">chief</span> <span class="itali">aim</span> nor will <span class="itali">infinite</span> <span class="itali">intelligence</span> translate that <span class="itali">purpose</span> into physical reality if you fill your mind with hatred, and envy, and jealousy, and selfishness and greed. These negative or <span class="itali">destructive</span> <span class="itali">thoughts</span> are the weeds which will choke out the seed of your <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">purpose.</span></p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="idsdbo1jlh5">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="idgoz4bpkgn">Remember that your real wealth can be measured, not by what you have, but, by what you are.</p><p class="ENDEND" id="idnnwbuh6cr">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idq30ahb3zb"><span class="itali">Creative</span> <span class="itali">thought</span> pre-supposes that you will keep your mind in a state of expectancy of attainment of the object of your <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">chief</span> <span class="itali">aim;</span> that you will have full <span class="itali">faith</span> and confidence in its attainment in due course and in due order.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ids917rmzfh">If this lesson does that which it was intended to do, it will bring you a fuller and deeper realization of the second lesson of this course, on Self-confidence. As you begin to learn how to plant the seed of your <span class="itali">desires</span> in the fertile soil of your sub-conscious mind, and how to fertilize that seed until it springs into life and action, you will then have reason, indeed, to believe in yourself.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id30s40fn0m">And, after you have reached this point in the process of your evolution, you will have sufficient knowledge of the real source from which you are drawing your power, to give full credit to <span class="itali">infinite</span> <span class="itali">intelligence</span> for all that you had previously credited to your Self-confidence.</p><p class="Blank-Space-BreakBsbrk" id="id0ih1gnpk2">[blank]</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id4hyaoletg">Auto-suggestion is a powerful weapon with which one may rise to heights of great achievement, when it is used constructively. Used in a negative manner, however, it may destroy all possibility of success, and if so used continuously it will actually destroy health.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ids0qs88ury">Careful comparison of the experiences of leading physicians and psychiatrists disclosed the startling information that approximately seventy-five per cent of those who are ill are suffering from hypochondria, which is a morbid state of mind causing useless anxiety about one&#x2019;s health.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idct63fyqmz">Stated in plain language, the hypochondriac is a person who believes he or she is suffering with some sort of imaginary disease, and often these unfortunates believe they have every disease of which they ever heard the name.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idr5bbz7led">Hypochondriacal conditions are generally superinduced by auto-intoxication, or poisoning through failure of the intestinal system to throw off the waste matter. The person who suffers with such a toxic condition is not only unable to think with accuracy, but suffers from all sorts of perverted, destructive, illusory thoughts. Many sick people have tonsils removed, or teeth pulled, or the appendix taken out, when their trouble could have been removed with an internal bath and a bottle of Citrate of Magnesia (with due apologies to my friends, the physicians, one of the leading of whom gave me this information).</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idw2acyjxih">Hypochondria is the beginning of most cases of insanity!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idk06sn4l2z">Dr. Henry R. Rose is authority for the following typical example of the power of Autosuggestion:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idx84enpbp2">&#x201C;&#x2018;If my wife dies I will not believe there is a God.&#x2019; His wife was ill with pneumonia, and this is the way he greeted me when I reached his home. She had sent for me because the doctor had told her she could not recover. (Most doctors know better than to make a statement such as this in the presence of a patient.) She had called her husband and two sons to her bedside and bidden them good-by. Then she asked that I, her minister, be sent for. I found the husband in the front room sobbing and the sons doing their best to brace her up. When I went into her room she was breathing with difficulty, and the trained nurse told me she was very low.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id66ptcyggk">&#x201C;I soon found that Mrs. N&#x2014;&#x2014;had sent for me to look after her two sons after she was gone. Then I said to her: &#x2018;You mustn&#x2019;t give up. YOU ARE NOT GOING TO DIE! You have always been a strong and healthy woman and I do not believe God wants you to die and leave your boys to me or anyone else.&#x2019;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id3dc06byxi">&#x201C;I talked to her along this line and then read the 103d Psalm and made a prayer in which I prepared her to get well rather than to enter eternity. I told her to put her faith in God and throw her mind and will against every thought of dying. Then I left her, saying, &#x2018;I will come again after the church service, and I will then find you much better.&#x2019;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idfbvj6ungo">&#x201C;This was on Sunday morning. I called that afternoon. Her husband met me with a smile. He said that the moment I had gone his wife called him and the boys into the room and said: &#x2018;Dr. Rose says that I am not going to die; that I am going to get well, and I am.&#x2019;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idgepre2mo9">&#x201C;She did get well. But what did it? Two things: Auto-suggestion, superinduced by the suggestion I had given her, and faith on her part. I came just in the nick of time, and so great was her faith in me that I was able to inspire faith in herself. It was that faith that tipped the scales and brought her through the pneumonia. No medicine can cure pneumonia. The physicians admit that. There are cases of pneumonia, perhaps, that nothing can cure. We all sadly agree to that, but there are times, as in this case, when the mind, if worked upon and worked with in just the right way, will turn the tide. While there is life there is hope; but hope must rule supreme and do the good that hope was intended to do.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idlw2ukrwk5">&#x201C;Here is another remarkable case showing the power of the human mind when used constructively. A physician asked me to see Mrs. H&#x2014;&#x2014;. He said there was nothing organically wrong with her, but she just wouldn&#x2019;t eat. Having made up her mind that she could not retain anything on her stomach, she had quit eating, and was slowly starving herself to death. I went to see her and found, first, that she had no religious belief. She had lost her faith in God. I also found that she had no confidence in her power to retain food. My first effort was to restore her faith in the Almighty and to get her to believe that He was with her and would give her power. Then I told her that she could eat anything she wanted. True, her confidence in me was great and my statement impressed her. She began to eat from that day! She was out of her bed in three days, for the first time in weeks. She is a normal, healthy and happy woman today.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idt9iwadxl4">&#x201C;What did it? The same forces as those described in the preceding case; outside suggestion (which she accepted in faith and applied, through self-suggestion) and inward confidence.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id5r35w55y0">&#x201C;There are times when the mind is sick and it makes the body sick. At such times it needs a stronger mind to heal it by giving it direction and especially by giving it confidence and faith in itself. This is called suggestion. It is transmitting your confidence and power to another, and with such force as to make the other believe as you wish and do as you will. It need not be hypnotism. You can get wonderful results with the patient wide awake and perfectly rational. The patient must believe in you and you must understand the workings of the human mind in order to meet the arguments and questions of the patient. Each one of us can be a healer of this sort and thus help our fellow men.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idiub1yqvro">&#x201C;It is the duty of every person to read some of the best books on the forces of the human mind and learn what amazing things the mind can do to keep people well and happy. We see the terrible things that wrong thinking does to people, even going to such lengths as to make them positively insane. It is high time we found out the good things the mind can do, not only to cure mental disorders, but physical diseases as well.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idm4vsrukvc">You should delve deeper into this subject.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idork9p8eb3">I do not say the mind can cure everything. There is no reliable evidence that certain forms of cancer have been cured by thinking or faith or any mental or religious process. If you would be cured of cancer you must take it at the very beginning and treat it surgically. There is no other way, and it would be criminal to suggest that there is. But the mind can do much with so many types of human indisposition and disease that we ought to rely upon it more often than we do.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id96n5ndsk3">Napoleon, during his campaign in Egypt, went among his soldiers who were dying by the hundreds of the black plague. He touched one of them and lifted a second, to inspire the others not to be afraid, for the awful disease seemed to spread as much by the aid of the imagination as in any other way.

It certainly will kill a man, or, on the other hand, it will help him rise to heights of achievement of the most astounding nature, providing he uses it as the basis of self-confidence. There are authentic cases on record of men having actually died because they imagined they were cut by a knife across the jugular vein, when in reality a piece of ice was used and water was allowed to drip so they could hear it and imagine their blood was running out. They had been blindfolded before the experiment was begun. No matter how well you may be when you start for work in the morning, if everyone you meet should say to you, &#x201C;How ill you look; you should see a doctor,&#x201D; it will not be long before you begin to feel ill, and if this keeps up a few hours you will arrive at home in the evening as limp as a rag and ready for a doctor. Such is the power of the imagination or Auto-suggestion.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ide9aa17mkz">The imaginative faculty of the human mind is a marvelous piece of mental machinery, but it may, and usually does, play queer tricks on us unless we keep constantly on guard and control it.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idr7gega23r">If you allow your imagination to &#x201C;expect the worst&#x201D; it will play havoc with you.

They placed her on the operating table and gave her anesthetics, when lo! the tumor immediately disappeared, and no operation was necessary. But when she came back to consciousness the tumor returned. The physician then learned that she had been living with a relative who had a real tumor, and that her imagination was so vivid that she had imagined this one upon herself. She was placed on the operating table again, given anesthetics and then she was strapped around the middle so that the tumor could not artificially return. When she revived she was told that a successful operation had been performed but that it would be necessary to wear the bandage for several days. She believed the doctor, and when the bandage was finally removed the tumor did not return. No operation whatever had been performed. She had simply relieved her sub-conscious mind of the thought that she had a tumor and her imagination had nothing to work upon save the idea of health, and, as she had never really been sick, of course she remained normal.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id6wx0pec1d">The mind may be cured of imaginary ills in exactly the same manner that it became diseased with those ills, by Auto-suggestion. The best time to work on a faulty imagination is at night, just as you are ready to go to sleep, for then the automatic or sub-conscious mind has everything its own way, and the thoughts or suggestions you give it just as your conscious or &#x201C;day&#x201D; mind is about to go off duty will be taken up and worked on during the night.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idlar5q0wnm">This may seem impossible, but you can easily test the principle by the following procedure: You wish to get up at seven o&#x2019;clock tomorrow morning, or at some hour other than your regular time to awaken. Say to yourself, as you are about ready to go to sleep, &#x201C;I must arise at seven o&#x2019;clock tomorrow without fail.&#x201D; Repeat this several times, at the same time impressing the fact upon your mind that you must actually arise at the precise moment mentioned. Turn this thought over to your sub-conscious mind with absolute confidence that you will awaken at seven o&#x2019;clock, and when that hour arrives your sub-conscious mind will awaken you. This test has been successfully made hundreds of times. The sub-conscious mind will awaken you, at any hour you demand, just as if someone came to your bed and tapped you on the shoulder. But you must give the command in no uncertain or indefinite terms.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iduiu2yn178">Likewise, the sub-conscious mind may be given any other sort of orders and it will carry them out as readily as it will awaken you at a given hour. For example, give the command, as you are about to go to sleep each night, for your sub-conscious mind to develop self-confidence, courage, initiative or any other quality, and it will do your bidding.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idythymcjgy">If the imagination of man can create imaginary ills and send one to bed with those ills, it can also, and just as easily, remove the cause of those ills.</p><p class="Blank-Space-BreakBsbrk" id="idiqqbdjokc">[blank]</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idfdhcm4edc">Man is a combination of chemical equivalents the value of which is said to be about twenty-six dollars, with the exception, of course, of that stupendous power called the human mind.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idpf5lbo94b">In the aggregate the mind seems to be a complicated machine, but in reality, as far as the manner in which it may be used is concerned, it is the nearest thing to perpetual motion that is known.

(Meaning that the conception of an idea is of greater importance than the transformation of that idea into more material form, because relatively few men can conceive useful ideas, while there are hundreds of millions who can develop an idea and give it material form after it has been conceived.)</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idujxm8ohtx"><span class="itali">Sixth:</span> The majority of all thoughts conceived in the minds of men are not ACCURATE, being more in the nature of &#x201C;opinions&#x201D; or &#x201C;snap-judgments.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idcxs8i5mny">When Alexander the Great sighed because he had no more worlds (as he believed) that could be conquered he was in a frame of mind similar to that of the present-day &#x201C;Alexanders&#x201D; of science, industry, invention, etc., whose &#x201C;accurate thoughts&#x201D; have conquered the air and the sea, explored practically every square mile of the little earth on which we live, and wrested from Nature thousands of &#x201C;secrets&#x201D; which, a few generations ago, would have been set down as &#x201C;miracles&#x201D; of the most astounding and imponderable sort.</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="id6q6a3zqoe">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="id2yxg5kd16">When a man really finds himself, at the top of the Ladder of Success, he is never alone, because no man can climb to genuine success without taking others along with him.</p><p class="ENDEND" id="idq3qgf12lq">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idd1k1byr29">In all this discovery and mastery of mere physical substances is it not strange, indeed, that we have practically neglected and overlooked the most marvelous of all powers, the human mind!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idwzioix72q">All scientific men who have made a study of the human mind readily agree on this&#x2014;that the surface has not yet been scratched in the study of the wonderful power which lies dormant in the mind of man, waiting, as the oak tree sleeps in the acorn, to be aroused and put to work. Those who have expressed themselves on the subject are of the opinion that the next great cycle of discovery lies in the realm of the human mind.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idp7gczblgh">The possible nature of these discoveries has been suggested, in many different ways, in practically every lesson of this course, particularly in this and the following lessons of the course.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idzozke6i10">If these suggestions appear to lead the student of this philosophy into deeper water than he or she is accustomed to, bear in mind the fact that the student has the privilege of stopping at any depth desired, until ready, through thought and study, to go further.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idxgp07r2c9">The author of this course has found it necessary to take the lead, and to keep far enough ahead, as it were, to induce the student to go at least a few paces ahead of the normal average range of human thought. It is not expected that any beginner will, at first, try to assimilate and put into use all that has been included in this philosophy. But, if the net result of the course is nothing more than to sow the seed of constructive thought in the mind of the student the author&#x2019;s work will have been completed. Time, plus the student&#x2019;s own desire for knowledge, will do the rest.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddcb80yey9">This is an appropriate place to state frankly that many of the suggestions passed on through this course would, if literally followed, lead the student far beyond the necessary bounds and present needs of what is ordinarily called business philosophy. Stated differently, this course goes more deeply into the functioning processes of the human mind than is necessary as far as the use of this philosophy as a means of achieving business or financial success is concerned.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id3oocnktne">However, it is presumed that many students of this course will wish to go more deeply into the study of mind power than may be required for purely material achievement, and the author has had in mind these students throughout the labor of organizing and writing this course.</p><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="idr0itx4ch2">Summary of Principles Involved in Accurate Thinking</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1mtfajcg9">We have discovered that the body of man is not singular, but plural&#x2014;that it consists of billions on top of billions of living, intelligent, individual cells which carry on a very definite, well organized work of building, developing and maintaining the human body.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idn27nljhud">We have discovered that these cells are directed, in their respective duties, by the subconscious or automatic action of the mind; that the subconscious section of the mind can be, to a very large extent, controlled and directed by the conscious or voluntary section of the mind.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="identhijchz">We have found that any idea or thought which is held in the mind, through repetition, has a tendency to direct the physical body to transform such thought or idea into its material equivalent. We have found that any order that is PROPERLY given to the sub-conscious section of the mind (through the law of Auto-suggestion) will be carried out unless it is side-tracked or countermanded by another and stronger order. We have found that the sub-conscious mind does not question the source from which it receives orders, nor the soundness of those orders, but it will proceed to direct the muscular system of the body to carry out any order it receives.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idxnagxufco">This explains the necessity for guarding closely the environment from which we receive suggestions, and by which we are subtly and quietly influenced at times and in ways of which we do not take cognizance through the conscious mind.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ido1bjflr7e">We have found that every movement of the human body is controlled by either the conscious or the sub-conscious section of the mind; that not a muscle can be moved until an order has been sent out by one or the other of these two sections of the mind, for the movement.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id0f4vrty72">When this principle is thoroughly understood we understand, also, the powerful effect of any idea or thought which we create through the faculty of IMAGINATION and hold in the conscious mind until the sub-conscious section of the mind has time to take over that thought and begin the work of transforming it into its material counterpart. When we understand the principle through which any idea is first placed in the conscious mind, and held there until the sub-conscious section of the mind picks it up and appropriates it, we have a practical working knowledge of the Law of Concentration, covered by the next lesson (and, it might be added, we have also a thorough understanding of the reason why the Law of Concentration is necessarily a part of this philosophy).</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id19vmphp0p">When we understand this working relationship between the imagination, the conscious mind and the sub-conscious section of the mind, we can see that the very first step in the achievement of any <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">chief</span> <span class="itali">aim</span> is to create a definite picture of that which is desired. This picture is then placed in the conscious mind, through the Law of Concentration, and held there (through the formulas described in the next lesson) until the sub-conscious section of the mind picks it up and translates it into its ultimate and desired form.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idfh1iyme2h">Surely this principle has been made clear. It has been stated and restated, over and over, not only for the purpose of thoroughly describing it, but, of greater importance, to IMPRESS UPON THE MIND OF THE STUDENT THE PART IT PLAYS IN ALL HUMAN ACHIEVEMENT.</p><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="id5yzgaleem">The Value of Adopting a Chief Aim</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idbo5igv37t">This lesson on Accurate Thought not only describes the real purpose of a <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">chief</span> <span class="itali">aim,</span> but it explains in simple terms the principles through which such an aim or purpose may be realized. We first create the objective toward which we are striving, through the imaginative faculty of the mind, then transfer an outline of this objective to paper by writing out a definite statement of it in the nature of a <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">chief</span> <span class="itali">aim.</span> By daily reference to this written statement the idea or thing aimed for is taken up by the conscious mind and handed over to the sub-conscious mind, which, in turn, directs the energies of the body to transform the desire into material form.</p><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="idukjjj5720">Desire</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idwnl69nrjk">Strong, deeply rooted desire is the starting point of all achievement. Just as the electron is the last unit of matter discernible to the scientist, DESIRE is the seed of all achievement; the starting place, back of which there is nothing, or at least there is nothing of which we have any knowledge.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idas7bl8lsl">A <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">chief</span> <span class="itali">aim,</span> which is only another name for DESIRE, would be meaningless unless based upon a deeply seated, strong desire for the object of the <span class="itali">chief</span> <span class="itali">aim.</span> Many people &#x201C;wish&#x201D; for many things, but a wish is not the equivalent of a strong DESIRE, and therefore wishes are of little or no value unless they are crystallized into the more definite form of DESIRE.</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="id6qvayrk5g">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="idrn6o9r6un">Wm.

It is through the operation of this same universal Law of Attraction that constant, deeply seated, strong DESIRE attracts the physical equivalent or counterpart of the thing desired, or the means of securing it.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idklr7ce9ro">We have learned, then, if this hypothesis is correct, that all cycles of human achievement work somewhat after this fashion: First, we picture in our conscious minds, through a <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">chief</span> <span class="itali">aim</span> (based upon a strong desire), some objective; we then focus our conscious mind upon this objective, by constant thought of it and belief in its attainment, until the subconscious section of the mind takes up the picture or outline of this objective and impels us to take the necessary physical action to transform that picture into reality.</p><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="idui1r4sbg0">Suggestion and Auto-Suggestion</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id7m8zafq8a">Through this and other lessons of the Law of Success course the student has learned that sense impressions arising out of one&#x2019;s environment, or from statements or actions of other people, are called suggestions, while sense impressions that we place in our own minds are placed there by self-suggestion, or Auto-suggestion.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idcwqdwu6ij">All suggestions coming from others, or from environment, influence us only after we have accepted them and passed them on to the sub-conscious mind, through the principle of Auto-suggestion, thus it is seen that suggestion becomes, and must become, Auto-suggestion before it influences the mind of the one receiving it.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idun9rbv0cg">Stated in another way, no one may influence another without the consent of the one influenced, as the influencing is done through one&#x2019;s own power of Auto-suggestion.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id07kk639zd">The conscious mind stands, during the hours when one is awake, as a sentinel, guarding the sub-conscious mind and warding off all suggestions which try to reach it from the outside, until those suggestions have been examined by the conscious mind, passed upon and accepted. This is Nature&#x2019;s way of safe-guarding the human being against intruders who would otherwise take control of any mind desired at will.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id3xk4bvins">It is a wise arrangement.</p><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="id89effx7sf">The Value of Auto-suggestion in Accomplishing the Object of Your Definite Chief Aim</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idggx5wrzgq">One of the greatest uses to which one may direct the power of Auto-suggestion is that of making it help accomplish the object of one&#x2019;s <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">chief</span> <span class="itali">aim</span> in life.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idaeuxqcfs7">The procedure through which this may be accomplished is very simple. While the exact formula has been stated in Lesson One, and referred to in many other lessons of the course, the principle upon which it is based will be here, again, described, viz.:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id7w2hb22iu">Write out a clear, concise statement of that which you intend to accomplish, as your <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">chief</span> <span class="itali">aim,</span> covering a period of, let us say, the next five years. Make at least two copies of your statement, one to be placed where you can read it several times a day, while you are at work, and the other to be placed in the room where you sleep, where it can be read several times each evening before you go to sleep and just after you arise in the morning.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idyawo1vezn">The suggestive influence of this procedure (impractical though it may seem) will soon impress the object of your <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">chief</span> <span class="itali">aim</span> on your sub-conscious mind and, as if by a stroke of magic, you will begin to observe events taking place which will lead you nearer and nearer the attainment of that object.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idjc0ilezoi">From the very day that you reach a definite decision in your own mind as to the precise thing, condition or position in life that you deeply desire, you will observe, if you read books, newspapers and magazines, that important news items and other data bearing on the object of your <span class="itali">definite</span> <span class="itali">chief</span> <span class="itali">aim</span> will begin to come to your attention; you will observe, also, that opportunities will begin to come to you that will, if embraced, lead you nearer and nearer the coveted goal of your desire. No one knows better than the author of this course how impossible and impractical this may seem to the person who is not informed on the subject of mind operation; however, this is not an age favorable to the doubter or the skeptic, and the best thing for any person to do is to experiment with this principle until its practicality has been established.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idmd25dz26h">To the present generation it may seem that there are no more worlds to conquer in the field of mechanical invention, but every thinker (even those who are not accurate thinkers) will concede that we are just entering a new era of evolution, experiment and analysis as far as the powers of the human mind are concerned.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idqcz70jk09">The word &#x201C;impossible&#x201D; means less now than ever before in the history of the human race. There are some who have actually removed this word from their vocabularies, believing that man can do anything he can imagine and BELIEVE HE CAN DO!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id4rnupoy4r">We have learned, for sure, that the universe is made up of two substances: matter and energy. Through patient scientific research we have discovered what we believe to be good evidence that everything that is or ever has been in the way of matter, when analyzed to the finest point, can be traced back to the electron, which is nothing but a form of energy. On the other hand, every material thing that man has created began in the form of energy, through the seed of an idea that was released through the imaginative faculty of the human mind. In other words, the beginning of every material thing is energy and the ending of it is energy.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idtzr9jq841">All matter obeys the command of one form or another of energy. The highest known form of energy is that which functions as the human mind. The human mind, therefore, is the sole directing force of everything man creates, and what he may create with this force in the future, as compared with that which he has created with it in the past, will make his past achievements seem petty and small.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id7ql2564h5">We do not have to wait for future discoveries in connection with the powers of the human mind for evidence that the mind is the greatest force known to mankind. We know, now, that any idea, aim or purpose that is fixed in the mind and held there with a will to achieve or attain its physical or material equivalent, puts into motion powers that cannot be conquered.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idh2nyucrhj">Buxton said: &#x201C;The longer I live the more certain I am that the great difference between men, between the feeble and the powerful, the great and the insignificant, is energy&#x2014;invincible determination&#x2014;a purpose once fixed, and then death or victory.

The desire must be placed in the mind and held there, with PERSISTENCE THAT KNOWS NO DEFEAT, until the automatic or subconscious mind takes it over.

However, as you began to follow the chain of <span class="itali">thought</span> along toward the close of the lesson, you perhaps found yourself being carried into waters too deep for you to fathom.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id4ksbqdcl4">Perhaps I can throw one final ray of light on the subject by reminding you that the sound of every voice, and of every note of music, and of every other nature that is being released at the time you are reading these lines is floating through the ether right where you are. To hear these sounds you need but the aid of a modern radio outfit.

It cannot be answered before. The passage-way can be reached only through the medium of <span class="itali">your</span> <span class="itali">own</span> <span class="itali">thoughts.</span> This is one reason why all the great philosophers of the past admonished man to know himself. &#x201C;Know thyself&#x201D; is and has been the cry of the ages.

To do so brings you no nearer that which you are seeking, but takes you further away from it.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddbmjatxix">And, it may be&#x2014;who knows but <span class="itali">you?</span>&#x2014;that even now, as you finish this lesson, you are nearer the door that leads to the secret passage-way to knowledge than you have ever been before.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id7n47h1c2r">With your mastery of this lesson will come a fuller understanding of the principle referred to in the Introduction as the &#x201C;Master Mind.&#x201D; Surely you now understand the reason for friendly co-operative alliance between two or more people.

When any habit has been well formed (by repetition of thought or action) the mind attaches itself to and follows that habit as closely as the phonograph needle follows the groove in the wax record, no matter what may be the nature of that habit.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id8qdib00f6">We begin to see, therefore, the importance of selecting our environment with the greatest of care, because environment is the mental feeding ground out of which the food that goes into our minds is extracted.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idpve0e7xnz">Environment very largely supplies the food and materials out of which we create <span class="itali">thought, </span>and <span class="itali">habit</span> crystallizes these into permanency. You of course understand that &#x201C;environment&#x201D; is the sum total of sources through which you are influenced by and through the aid of the five senses of seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting and feeling.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id52o43ezmx">&#x201C;Habit is force which is generally recognized by the average thinking person, but which is commonly viewed in its adverse aspect to the exclusion of its favorable phase. It has been well said that all men are &#x2018;the creatures of habit,&#x2019; and that &#x2018;habit is a cable; we weave a thread of it each day and it becomes so strong that we cannot break it.&#x2019;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idwttr86apu">&#x201C;If it be true that habit becomes a cruel tyrant, ruling and compelling men against their will, desire, and inclination&#x2014;and this is true in many cases&#x2014;the question naturally arises in the thinking mind whether this mighty force cannot be harnessed and controlled in the service of men, just as have other forces of Nature. If this result can be accomplished, then man may master habit and set it to work, instead of being a slave to it and serving it faithfully though complaining. And the modern psychologists tell us in no uncertain tones that habit may certainly be thus mastered, harnessed and set to work, instead of being allowed to dominate one&#x2019;s actions and character. And thousands of people have applied this new knowledge and have turned the force of habit into new channels, and have compelled it to work their machinery of action, instead of being allowed to run to waste, or else permitted to sweep away the structures that men have erected with care and expense, or to destroy fertile mental fields.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id8n5hc5piu">&#x201C;A habit is a &#x2018;mental path&#x2019; over which our actions have traveled for some time, each passing making the path a little deeper and a little wider. If you have to walk over a field or through a forest, you know how natural it is for you to choose the clearest path in preference to the less worn ones, and greatly in preference to stepping out across the field or through the woods and making a new path. And the line of mental action is precisely the same. It is movement along the lines of least resistance&#x2014;passage over the well-worn path. Habits are created by repetition and are formed in accordance to a natural law, observable in all animate things and some would say in inanimate things as well. As an instance of the latter, it is pointed out that a piece of paper once folded in a certain way will fold along the same lines the next time. And all users of sewing machines, or other delicate pieces of machinery, know that as a machine or instrument is once &#x2018;broken in&#x2019; so will it tend to run thereafter. The same law is also observable in the case of musical instruments. Clothing or gloves form into creases according to the person using them, and these creases once formed will always be in effect, notwithstanding repeated pressings. Rivers and streams of water cut their courses through the land, and thereafter flow along the habit-course. The law is in operation everywhere.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idrcons1iqy">&#x201C;These illustrations will help you to form the idea of the nature of habit, and will aid you in forming new mental paths&#x2014;new mental creases. And&#x2014;remember this always&#x2014;the best (and one might say the only) way in which old habits may be removed is to form new habits to counteract and replace the undesirable ones. Form new mental paths over which to travel, and the old ones will soon become less distinct and in time will practically fill up from disuse. Every time you travel over the path of the desirable mental habit, you make the path deeper and wider, and make it so much easier to travel it thereafter. This mental path making is a very important thing, and I cannot urge upon you too strongly the injunction to start to work making the desirable mental paths over which you wish to travel. Practice, practice, practice&#x2014;be a good path-maker.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddao77us5c">The following are the rules of procedure through which you may form the habits you desire:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idorjm153tw"><span class="itali">First:</span> At the beginning of the formation of a new habit put force and enthusiasm into your expression. Feel what you think. Remember that you are taking the first steps toward making the new mental path; that it is much harder at first than it will be afterwards. Make the path as clear and as deep as you can, at the beginning, so that you can readily see it the next time you wish to follow it.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iduasd5l1dx"><span class="itali">Second:</span> Keep your attention firmly <span class="itali">concentrated</span> on the new path-building, and keep your mind away from the old paths, lest you incline toward them. Forget all about the old paths, and concern yourself only with the new ones that you are building to order.</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="id2oyz12oe7">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="idez8lcts3n">It is a striking coincidence that &#x201C;American&#x201D; ends with &#x201C;I can.&#x201D;</p><p class="ENDEND" id="id6a3wo9y7a">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idk6q10ehsy"><span class="itali">Third:</span> Travel over your newly made paths as often as possible. Make opportunities for doing so, without waiting for them to arise through luck or chance. The oftener you go over the new paths the sooner will they become well worn and easily traveled. Create plans for passing over these new habit-paths, at the very start.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idhbamhs2d1"><span class="itali">Fourth:</span> Resist the temptation to travel over the older, easier paths that you have been using in the past. Every time you resist a temptation, the stronger do you become, and the easier will it be for you to do so the next time. But every time you yield to the temptation, the easier does it become to yield again, and the more difficult it becomes to resist the next time. You will have a fight on at the start, and this is the critical time. Prove your determination, persistency and will-power now, at the very beginning.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idrphuovcf9"><span class="itali">Fifth:</span> Be sure that you have mapped out the right path, as your <span class="itali">definite chief aim,</span> and then go ahead without fear and without allowing yourself to doubt. &#x201C;Place your hand upon the plow, and look not backward.&#x201D; Select your goal, then make good, deep, wide mental paths leading straight to it.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idcukunjg5d">As you have already observed, there is a close relationship between <span class="itali">habit</span> and <span class="itali">Auto-suggestion </span>(self-suggestion). Through habit, an act repeatedly performed in the same manner has a tendency to become permanent, and eventually we come to perform the act automatically or unconsciously. In playing a piano, for example, the artist can play a familiar piece while his or her conscious mind is on some other subject.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idserayjb6h">Auto-suggestion is the tool with which we dig a mental path; Concentration is the hand that holds that tool; and Habit is the map or blueprint which the mental path follows. An idea or desire, to be transformed into terms of action or physical reality, must be held in the conscious mind <span class="itali">faithfully</span> and <span class="itali">persistently</span> until <span class="itali">habit</span> begins to give it permanent form.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idzbgd8d1ih">Let us turn our attention, now, to <span class="itali">environment.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id4bjbrj5a5">As we have already seen, we absorb the material for thought from our surrounding environment. The term &#x201C;environment&#x201D; covers a very broad field. It consists of the books we read, the people with whom we associate, the community in which we live, the nature of the work in which we are engaged, the country or nation in which we reside, the clothes we wear, the songs we sing, and, most important of all, <span class="itali">the religious and intellectual training we receive prior to the age of fourteen years.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iduq9uq4ho4">The purpose of analyzing the subject of <span class="itali">environment</span> is to show its direct relationship to the personality we are developing, and the importance of so guarding it that its influence will give us the materials out of which we may attain our <span class="itali">definite chief aim</span> in life.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id4gvm8hoiv">The mind feeds upon that which we supply it, or that which is forced upon it, through our <span class="itali">environment;</span> therefore, let us select our environment, as far as possible, with the object of supplying the mind with suitable material out of which to carry on its work of attaining our <span class="itali">definite chief aim.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idpyugzxx2n">If <span class="itali">your</span> environment is not to your liking, change it!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id54eb1v2jr">The first step is to create in your own mind an exact, clear and well rounded out picture of the environment in which you believe you could best attain your <span class="itali">definite chief aim,</span> and then <span class="itali">concentrate</span> your mind upon this picture until you transform it into reality.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idhfi02ik2q">In Lesson One, of this course, you learned that the first step you must take, in the accomplishment of any <span class="itali">desire,</span> is to create in your mind a clear, well defined picture of that which you intend to accomplish. This is the first principle to be observed in your plans for the achievement of <span class="itali">success,</span> and if you fail or neglect to observe it, you cannot succeed, except by chance.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idppi4k60vk">Your daily associates constitute one of the most important and influential parts of your environment, and may work for your progress or your retrogression, according to the nature of those associates. As far as possible, you should select as your most <span class="itali">intimate</span> daily associates those who are in sympathy with your aims and ideals&#x2014;especially those represented by your <span class="itali">definite chief aim&#x2014;</span>and whose mental attitude inspires you with enthusiasm, self-confidence, determination and ambition.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idnpdr4oiuc">Remember that every word spoken within your hearing, every sight that reaches your eyes, and every sense impression that you receive through any of the five senses, influences your thought as surely as the sun rises in the east and sets in the west. This being true, can you not see the importance of controlling, as far as possible, the environment in which you live and work?

No unbeliever ever enjoyed the benefits of this Magic Key. You must believe in the test that you are about to make.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idczbkr8om7">We will assume that you have thought something about becoming a successful writer, or a powerful public speaker, or a successful business executive, or an able financier. We will take public speaking as the subject of this test, but remember that you must follow instructions to the letter.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idm45k6bsa8">Take a plain sheet of paper, ordinary letter size, and write on it the following:</p><p class="EXTRACT-AEXT-A" id="idtq6dlggge">EXTRACT-A</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idy5tetb6bi">I am going to become a powerful public speaker because this will enable me to render the world useful service that is needed&#x2014;and because it will yield me a financial return that will provide me with the necessary material things of life.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id3w0ph3bii">I will concentrate my mind upon this desire for ten minutes daily, just before retiring at night and just after arising in the morning, for the purpose of determining just how I shall proceed to transform it into reality.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id5c9t90x3b">I know that I can become a powerful and magnetic speaker, therefore I will permit nothing to interfere with my doing so.</p><p class="SignatureSig" id="idegm1b8m3t"><span class="itali">Signed</span>.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. .&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. .&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. .&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. .&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. .&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. .&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.</p><p class="ENDEND" id="idml1szb9fc">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idu711nvn4a">Sign this pledge, then proceed to do as you have pledged your word that you would do.

See, in your imagination, an appropriate income. See yourself in your own home that you have purchased with the proceeds from your efforts as a speaker or lecturer. See yourself in possession of a nice bank account as a reserve for old age. See yourself as a person of influence, due to your great ability as a public speaker. See yourself engaged in a life-calling in which you will not fear the loss of your position.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id69bwqxtt8">Paint this picture clearly, through the powers of your imagination, and lo! it will soon become transformed into a beautiful picture of deeply seated <span class="itali">desire.</span> Use this <span class="itali">desire</span> as the chief object of your <span class="itali">concentration</span> and observe what happens.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idpc3oxgcc8">You now have the secret of the Magic Key!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9hm2az2bl">Do not underestimate the power of the Magic Key because it did not come to you clothed in mysticism, or because it is described in language which all who will may understand.

For example, ordinary water, known in chemistry under the formula of H<span class="subsub">2</span>O, is a compound consisting of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen, <span class="itali">but water is neither hydrogen nor oxygen.</span> This &#x201C;marrying&#x201D; of elements creates <span class="itali">an entirely different substance from that of either of its component parts.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idje1botqln">The same law through which this transformation of physical elements takes place may be responsible for the seemingly superhuman powers resulting from the alliance of two or more people, <span class="itali">in a perfect state of harmony and understanding,</span> for the attainment of a given end.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idbggb6dpqm">This world, and all matter of which the other planets consist, is made up of electrons (an electron being the smallest known analyzable unit of matter, and resembling, in nature, what we call electricity, or a form of energy). On the other hand, <span class="itali">thought,</span> and that which we call the &#x201C;mind,&#x201D; is also a form of energy; in fact it is the highest form of energy known. Thought, in other words, is <span class="itali">organized energy,</span> and it is not improbable that <span class="itali">thought</span> is exactly the same sort of energy as that which we generate with an electric dynamo, although of a much more highly <span class="itali">organized</span> form.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idzsjn5o1x8">Now, if all matter, in final analysis, consists of groups of electrons, which are nothing more than a form of energy which we call electricity, and if the mind is nothing but a form of highly organized electricity, do you not see how it is possible that the laws which affect matter may also govern the mind?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddpn3ms3ak">And if combining two or more elements of matter, in the proper proportion and under the right conditions, will produce something entirely different from those original elements (as in the case of H<span class="subsub">2</span>O), do you not see how it is possible so to combine the energy of two or more minds that the result will be a sort of composite mind that is totally different from the individual minds of which it consists?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idqew16a3ab">You have undoubtedly noticed the manner in which you are influenced while in the presence of other people. Some people inspire you with optimism and enthusiasm. Their very presence seems to stimulate your own mind to greater action, and, this not only &#x201C;seems&#x201D; to be true, but it <span class="itali">is true.</span> You have noticed that the presence of others had a tendency to lower your vitality and depress you; a tendency which I can assure you was very <span class="itali">real!</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idcztu1gafh">What, do you imagine, could be the cause of these changes that come over us when we come within a certain range of other people, unless it is the change resulting from the blending or combining of their minds with our own, through the operation of a law that is not very well understood, but resembles (if, in fact, it is not the same law) the law through which the combining of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen produces water.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id0olhdsk5s">I have no scientific basis for this hypothesis, but I have given it many years of serious thought and always I come to the conclusion that it is at least a sound hypothesis, although I have no possible way, as yet, of reducing it to a provable hypothesis.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idszzu7let9">You need no proof, however, that the presence of some people inspires you, while the presence of others depresses you, as you know this to be a fact.

She had heard of chemistry, and of botany, and of biology, and of pathology, and of psychology, and of many other subjects that were of importance in the field of education.

He is recognized both in the field of psychology and in other directly and indirectly related fields of science, throughout the world, as being a man of the highest scientific standing.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idetpkhxhi0">Come with me, for a moment, and study his methods!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idz0eac9np3">After Dr. Gates has followed a line of investigation as far as possible through the usual channels of research, and has availed himself of all the recorded facts at his command, on a given subject, he then takes a pencil and a tablet and &#x201C;sits&#x201D; for further information, by <span class="itali">concentrating his mind on that subject until thoughts related to it begin to FLOW IN UPON HIM.</span> He writes down these thoughts, as they come (from he knows not where). He told me that many of his most important discoveries came through this method. It was more than twenty years ago that I first talked with Dr. Gates on this subject. Since that time, through the discovery of the radio principle, we have been provided with a reasonable hypothesis through which to explain the results of these &#x201C;sittings,&#x201D; viz.:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idai0t9gbt9">The ether, as we have discovered through the modern radio apparatus, is in a constant state of agitation. Sound waves are floating through the ether at all times, but these waves cannot be detected, beyond a short distance from their source, except by the aid of properly attuned instruments.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idyu8s57z2e">Now, it seems reasonable to suppose that <span class="itali">thought,</span> being the most highly organized form of energy known, is constantly sending waves through the ether, but these waves, like those of sound, can only be detected and correctly interpreted by a properly attuned mind.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idcfgoljo5l">There is no doubt that when Dr. Gates sat down in a room and placed himself in a quiet, passive state of mind, the dominating <span class="itali">thoughts</span> in his mind served as a magnetic force that attracted the related or similar <span class="itali">thought waves</span> of others as they passed through the ether about him.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id6jsctfh4v">Taking the hypothesis just a step further, it has occurred to me many times since the discovery of the modern radio principle, that <span class="itali">every thought that has ever been released in organized form, from the mind of any human being, is still in existence in the form of a wave in the ether, and is constantly passing around and around in a great endless circle;</span> that the act of <span class="itali">concentrating</span> one&#x2019;s mind upon a given subject with intensity sends out <span class="itali">thought waves</span> which reach and blend with those of a related or similar nature, thereby establishing a direct line of communication between the one doing the <span class="itali">concentrating</span> and the thoughts of a similar nature which have been previously set into motion.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idghaa1rfsl">Going still a step further, may it not be possible for one so to attune his mind and harmonize the rate of vibration of <span class="itali">thought</span> with the rate of vibration of the ether that all knowledge that has been accumulated through the <span class="itali">organized thoughts</span> of the past is available?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idd27nbhb1r">With these hypotheses in mind, go back to Lesson One, of this course, and study Carnegie&#x2019;s description of the &#x201C;master mind&#x201D; through which he accumulated his great fortune.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idr1953s6sv">When Carnegie formed an alliance between more than a score of carefully selected minds, he created, by that means of compounding mind power, one of the strongest industrial forces that the world has ever witnessed.

Nearly thirty years ago he adopted a policy of standardization as to the general type of automobile that he would build, and he consistently maintained that policy until the change in public demand forced him, in 1927, to change it.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9gaocpc7p">A few years ago, I met the former chief engineer of the Ford plant, and he told me of an incident that happened during the early stages of Mr. Ford&#x2019;s automobile experience which very clearly points to <span class="itali">concentrated effort</span> as being one of his prominent fundamentals of economic philosophy.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idw6xs4zm5k">On this occasion the engineers of the Ford plant had gathered in the engineering office for the purpose of discussing a proposed change in the design of the rear axle construction of the Ford automobile. Mr. Ford stood around and listened to the discussion until each man had had his &#x201C;say,&#x201D; then he walked over to the table, tapped the drawing of the proposed axle with his finger, and said:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idfs0jhu6x1">&#x201C;Now listen! the axle we are using does the work for which it was intended, and does it well, and there&#x2019;s going to be no more change in that axle!&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ide6wy1ipc6">He turned and walked away, and from that day until this the rear axle construction of the Ford automobile has remained substantially the same. It is not improbable that Mr. Ford&#x2019;s success in building and marketing automobiles has been due, very largely, to his policy of consistently <span class="itali">concentrating</span> his efforts back of one plan, with but one <span class="itali">definite purpose</span> in mind at a time.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idyx1iaavgv">A few years ago I read Edward Bok&#x2019;s book, <span class="itali">The Man from Maine,</span> which is the biography of his father-in-law, Mr. Cyrus H. K. Curtis, the owner of the <span class="itali">Saturday Evening Post,</span> the <span class="itali">Ladies&#x2019; Home Journal,</span> and several other publications.

This process may be likened to the recording of a picture on the sensitized plate of a camera or kodak.</p><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="id8uw1ic02r"><span class="boldb">2.</span> <span class="itali">Recall:</span> The reviving or recalling into the conscious mind of those sense impressions which have been recorded in the sub-conscious mind. This process may be compared to the act of going through a card index and pulling out a card on which information had been previously recorded.</p><p class="Num-Level-1-ListNl1" id="idfbit4lwfb"><span class="boldb">3.</span> <span class="itali">Recognition:</span> The ability to recognize a sense impression when it is called into the conscious mind, and to identify it as being a duplicate of the original impression, and to associate it with the original source from which it came when it was first recorded. This process enables us to distinguish between &#x201C;memory&#x201D; and &#x201C;imagination.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idrhpdk1pnl">These are the three principles that enter into the act of remembering. Now let us make application of these principles and determine how to use them effectively, which may be done as follows:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idsxczoiik3"><span class="itali">First:</span> When you wish to be sure of your ability to recall a sense impression, such as a name, date or place, be sure to make the impression vivid by <span class="itali">concentrating your attention upon it</span> to the finest detail. An effective way to do this is to repeat, several times, that which you wish to remember. Just as a photographer must give an &#x201C;exposure&#x201D; proper time to record itself on the sensitized plate of the camera, so must we give the sub-conscious mind time to record properly and clearly any sense impression that we wish to be able to recall with readiness.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idl4y70gp72"><span class="itali">Second:</span> Associate that which you wish to remember with some other object, name, place or date with which you are quite familiar, and which you can easily recall when you wish, as, for example, the name of your home town, your close friend, the date of your birth, etc., for your mind will then file away the sense impression that you wish to be able to recall, with the one that you can easily recall, so that when bringing forth one into the conscious mind it brings, also, the other one with it.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id8rmbfyogv"><span class="itali">Third:</span> Repeat that which you wish to remember, a number of times, at the same time <span class="itali">concentrating</span> your mind upon it, just as you would fix your mind on a certain hour at which you wished to arise in the morning, which, as you know, insures your awakening at that precise hour. The common failing of not being able to remember the names of other people, which most of us have, is due entirely to the fact that we do not properly record the name in the first place. When you are introduced to a person whose name you wish to be able to recall at will, repeat that name four or five times, first making sure that you understood the name correctly. If the name is similar to that of some person whom you know well, associate the two names together, thinking of both as you repeat the name of the one whose name you wish to be able to recall.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id0o56bko36">If someone gives you a letter to be mailed, look at the letter, then increase its size, in your imagination, and see it hanging over a letter-box. Fix in your mind a letter approximately the size of a door, and associate it with a letter box, and you will observe that the first letter box you pass on the street will cause you to recall that big, odd-looking letter, which you have in your pocket.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id026c4p12i">Suppose that you were introduced to a lady whose name was Elizabeth Shearer, and you wished to be able to recall her name at will. As you repeat her name associate with it a large pair of scissors, say ten feet in length, and Queen Elizabeth, and you will observe that the recalling of either the large pair of scissors or the name of Queen Elizabeth will help you recall, also, the name of Elizabeth Shearer.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idyxip433dy">If you wish to be able to remember the name of Lloyd Keith, just repeat the name several times and associate with it the name of Lloyd George and Keith&#x2019;s Theater, either of which you can easily recall at will.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idpv4tb4ocw">The <span class="itali">law of association</span> is the most important feature of a well trained memory, yet it is a very simple law. All you have to do to make use of it is to record the name of that which you wish to remember with the name of that which you <span class="itali">can readily</span> remember, and the recalling of one brings with it the other.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idw5x1xnabo">Nearly ten years ago a friend gave me his residence telephone number, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and although I did not write it down I remember it today as well as I did the day he gave it to me. This is the way that I recorded it:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idtl27chhuh">The number and exchange were Lakeview 2651.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idzglqt0eg9">At the time he gave me the number we were standing at the railroad station, in sight of Lake Michigan; therefore, I used the lake as an associated object with which to file the name of the telephone exchange. It so happened that the telephone number was made up of the age of my brother, who was 26, and my father, who was 51, therefore I associated their names with the number, thus insuring its recall. To recall the telephone exchange and number, therefore, I had only to think of Lake Michigan, my brother and my father.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id3tl44heoq">An acquaintance of mine found himself to be suffering from what is ordinarily called a &#x201C;wandering mind.&#x201D; He was becoming &#x201C;absent-minded&#x201D; and unable to remember.

For a decade I have been a department manager in a large factory. At first my duties were easy, then the firm had a rapid expansion of business which gave me added responsibilities. Several of the young men in my department developed unusual energy and ability&#x2014;at least one of them had his eye on my job.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id4jir1vbjw">&#x201C;I had reached the age in life when a man likes to be comfortable and, having been with the company a long time, I felt that I could safely settle back into an easy berth. The effect of this mental attitude was well nigh disastrous to my position.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id6p307bg6x">&#x201C;About two years ago I noticed that my power of <span class="itali">concentration</span> was weakening and my duties were becoming irksome. I neglected my correspondence until I looked with dread upon the formidable pile of letters; reports accumulated and subordinates were inconvenienced by the delay. I sat at my desk with my mind wandering elsewhere.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idfk1318wzv">&#x201C;Other circumstances showed plainly that my mind was not on my work; I forgot to attend an important meeting of the officers of the company. One of the clerks under me caught a bad mistake made in an estimate on a carload of goods, and, of course, saw to it that the manager learned of the incident.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idp2d2ijh6c">&#x201C;I was thoroughly alarmed at the situation! and asked for a week&#x2019;s vacation to think things over. I was determined to resign, or find the trouble and remedy it. A few days of earnest introspection at an out-of-the-way mountain resort convinced me that I was suffering from a plain case of mind wandering. I was lacking in <span class="itali">concentration;</span> my physical and mental activities at the desk had become desultory. I was careless and shiftless and neglectful&#x2014;all because my mind was not <span class="itali">alertly</span> on the job. When I had diagnosed my case with satisfaction to myself I next sought the remedy. I needed a complete new set of <span class="itali">working habits,</span> and I made a resolve to acquire them.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id4u68tdtbp">&#x201C;With paper and pencil I outlined a schedule to cover the working day: first, the morning mail; then, the orders to be filled; dictation; conference with subordinates and miscellaneous duties; ending with a clean desk before I left.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ideihxy1gjs"><span class="itali">&#x201C;&#x2018;How is habit formed?&#x2019;</span> I asked myself mentally. &#x2018;By repetition,&#x2019; came back the answer. &#x2018;But I have been doing these things over and over thousands of times,&#x2019; the other fellow in me protested. &#x2018;True, but not in orderly <span class="itali">concentrated</span> fashion,&#x2019; replied the echo.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id38fbcruo1">&#x201C;I returned to the office with mind in leash, but restless, and placed my new working schedule in force at once. I performed the same duties with the same zest and as nearly as possible at the same time every day. When my mind started to slip away I quickly brought it back.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idqljl9a1dn">&#x201C;From a mental stimulus, created by will-power, I progressed in <span class="itali">habit building.</span> Day after day, I practiced <span class="itali">concentration</span> of thought. When I found <span class="itali">repetition</span> becoming comfortable, then I knew that I had won.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idfbs33f0e4">Your ability to train your memory, or to develop any desired habit, is a matter, solely, of being able to <span class="itali">fix your attention on a given subject until the outline of that subject has been thoroughly impressed upon the &#x201C;sensitized plate&#x201D; of your mind.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id8j1e4at0u"><span class="itali">Concentration,</span> itself, is nothing but a matter of control of the <span class="itali">attention!</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idmreuasgj8">You will observe that by reading a line of print with which you are not familiar, and which you have never seen before, and then closing your eyes, you can see that line as plainly as though you were looking at it on the printed page. In reality, you are &#x201C;looking at it,&#x201D; not on the printed page, but on the sensitized plate of your own mind. If you try this experiment and it does not work the first time it is because you did not <span class="itali">concentrate your attention</span> on the line closely enough!

But this is not all, nor is it the most important part of a hypothesis at which I have arrived after many years of careful research, for I am satisfied that one may just as easily go a step further and &#x201C;tune in&#x201D; on the <span class="itali">universal mind</span> in which all knowledge is stored where it may be appropriated by all who master the art of coming after it.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id8tkcwrxuw">To a highly orthodox mind these statements may seem very irrational; but, to the student (and, so far, there are but few people in the world who are more than mere students, of an elementary grade, of this subject) who has studied this subject with any appreciable degree of understanding, these hypotheses seem not only possible, but <span class="itali">absolutely probable.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2y8yfqtju">But put the hypothesis to a test of your own!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idzbfuo61o6">You can select no better subject upon which to try an experiment than that which you have selected as your <span class="itali">definite chief aim</span> in life.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1tc5vk68j">Memorize your <span class="itali">definite chief aim</span> so you can repeat it without looking at the written page, then make a practice of <span class="itali">fixing your attention on it at least twice a day,</span> proceeding as follows:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idvlr8cntpi">Go into some quiet place where you will not be disturbed; sit down and completely relax your mind and your body; then close your eyes and place your fingers in your ears, thereby excluding the ordinary sound waves and all of the light waves. In that position repeat your <span class="itali">definite chief aim</span> in life, and as you do so see yourself, in your imagination, in full possession of the object of that aim. If a part of your aim is the accumulation of money, as it undoubtedly is, then see yourself in possession of that money. If a part of the object of your <span class="itali">definite aim</span> is the ownership of a home, then see a picture of that home, in your imagination, just as you expect to see it in reality.

They go through the world, thanks to our faulty educational system, without having discovered the strength which lies dormant in their own minds.

The problem, then, is to learn how to select the right sort of seed and how to sow that seed so that it takes root and grows quickly. We are sowing seed in our minds daily, hourly, nay, every second, but we are doing it promiscuously and more or less unconsciously.

He created in his own mind, for one reason or another, a picture of what he desired and then proceeded to transform that picture into reality.

He was born and reared among the hardy mountaineers of the Tennessee woods. There is not even a railroad in Fentress County. During his earlier years he was reputed to be a desperate character. He was what was known as a gunman. He was a dead shot with a revolver, and his prowess with the rifle was known far and wide among the plain people of the Tennessee hills.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id5omllwwi0">One day a religious organization pitched its tent in the community in which York and his parents lived. It was a strange sect that came to the mountains looking for converts, but the methods of the evangels of the new cult were full of fire and emotionalism. They denounced the sinner, the vile character and the man who took advantage of his neighbor.

Mr. J. A. Fisk gives us an interesting account of the influence of mental suggestion in the revival meeting, which bears out the statement that the crowd mind blends into one, as follows:</p><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="idf1nwflivs">Mental Suggestion in the Revival</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ido36g68rsp">Modern psychology has firmly established the fact that the greater part of the phenomena of the religious &#x201C;revival&#x201D; are <span class="itali">psychical</span> rather than spiritual in their nature, and <span class="itali">abnormally psychical</span> at that. The leading authorities recognize the fact that the mental excitement attendant upon the emotional appeals of the &#x201C;revivalist&#x201D; must be classified with the phenomena of hypnotic suggestion rather than with that of true religious experience. And those who have made a close study of the subject believe that instead of such excitement tending to elevate the mind and exalt the spirit of the individual, it serves to weaken and degrade the mind and prostitute the spirit by dragging it in the mud of abnormal psychic frenzy and emotional excess. In fact, by some careful observers, familiar with the respective phenomena, the religious &#x201C;revival&#x201D; meeting is classed with the public hypnotic &#x201C;entertainment&#x201D; as a typical example of psychic intoxication and hysterical excess.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id87ggvheky">David Starr Jordan, chancellor emeritus of Leland Stanford University, says: &#x201C;Whisky, cocaine and alcohol bring temporary insanity, and so does a revival of religion.&#x201D; The late Professor William James, of Harvard University, the eminent psychologist, says: &#x201C;Religious revivalism is more dangerous to the life of society than drunkenness.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id00q3z2g26">It should be unnecessary to state that in this lesson the term &#x201C;revival&#x201D; is used in the narrower signification indicating the typical religious emotional excitement known by the term in question, and is not intended to apply to the older and respected religious experience designated by the same term, which was so highly revered among the Puritans, Lutherans and others in the past. A standard reference work speaks of the general subject of the &#x201C;revival&#x201D; as follows:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id0hd7qofy4">&#x201C;Revivals occur in all religions. When one takes place a large number of persons who have been comparatively dead or indifferent to spiritual considerations simultaneously or in quick succession become alive to their importance, alter spiritually and morally, and act with exceeding zeal in converting others to their views. A Mohammedan revival takes the form of a return to the strict doctrines of the Koran, and a desire to propagate them by the sword. A Christian minority living in the place is in danger of being massacred by the revivalists. Pentecostal effusion of the Holy Spirit produced a revival within the infant church, followed by numerous conversions from outside. Revivals, though not called by that name, occurred at intervals from apostolic times till the Reformation, the revivalists being sometimes so unsympathetically treated that they left the church and formed sects, while, in other cases, and notably in those of the founders of the monastic orders, they were retained and acted on the church as a whole. The spiritual impulse which led to the Reformation, and the antagonistic one which produced or attended the rise of the Society of Jesus, were both revivalist. It is, however, to sudden increase of spiritual activity within the Protestant churches that the term &#x2018;revival&#x2019; is chiefly confined. The enterprise of the Wesleys and Whitefield in this country and England from 1738 onward was thoroughly revivalist.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. Since then, various revivals have from time to time occurred, and nearly all denominations aim at their production. The means adopted are prayer for the Holy Spirit, meetings continued night after night, often to a late hour, stirring addresses, chiefly from revivalist laymen, and after-meetings to deal with those impressed. Ultimately it has been found that some of those apparently converted have been steadfast, others have fallen back, while deadness proportioned to the previous excitement temporarily prevails. Sometimes excitable persons at revival meetings utter piercing cries, or even fall prostrate.</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="idweybzsmox">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="idwqw9mfaho">Nothing is so contagious as enthusiasm.

There is a crowd of separate individuals, and a composite crowd in which the emotional natures of the units seem to blend and fuse. The change from the first-named crowd to the second arises from the influence of earnest attention, or deep emotional appeals or common interest. When this change occurs the crowd becomes a composite individual, the degree of whose intelligence and emotional control is but little above that of its weakest member. This fact, startling as it may appear to the average reader, is well known and is admitted by the leading psychologists of the day; and many important essays and books have been written thereupon. The predominant characteristics of this &#x201C;composite-mindedness&#x201D; of a crowd are the evidences of extreme suggestibility, response to appeals of emotion, vivid imagination, and action arising from imitation&#x2014;all of which are mental traits universally manifested by primitive man. In short, the crowd manifests <span class="itali">atavism,</span> or reversion to early racial traits.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idcxzf5asac">Diall, in his Psychology of the Aggregate Mind of an Audience, holds that the mind of an assemblage listening to a powerful speaker undergoes a curious process called &#x201C;fusion,&#x201D; by which the individuals in the audience, losing their personal traits for the time being, to a greater or less degree, <span class="itali">are reduced, as it were, to a single individual, whose characteristics are those of an impulsive youth of twenty, imbued in general with high ideals, but lacking in reasoning power and will.</span> Tarde, the French psychologist, advances similar views.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9swjy00be">Professor Joseph Jastrow, in his Fact and Fable in Psychology, says:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idf6wk4jvm9">&#x201C;In the production of this state of mind a factor as yet unmentioned plays a leading r&#xF4;le, the power of mental contagion. Error, like truth, flourishes in crowds. At the heart of sympathy each finds a home.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. No form of contagion is so insidious in its outset, so difficult to check in its advance, so certain to leave germs that may at any moment reveal their pernicious power, as a mental contagion&#x2014;the contagion of fear, of panic, of fanaticism, of lawlessness, of superstition, of error.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. In brief, we must add to the many factors which contribute to deception, the recognized lowering of critical ability, of the power of accurate observation, indeed, of rationality, which merely being one of a crowd induces. The conjurer finds it easy to perform to a large audience, because, among other reasons, it is easier to arouse their admiration and sympathy, easier to make them forget themselves and enter into the uncritical spirit of wonderland. It would seem that in some respects the critical tone of an assembly, like the strength of a chain, is that of its weakest member.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idf6fkdrqhc">Professor Le Bon, in his <span class="itali">The Crowd,</span> says:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idcnm7fefl2">&#x201C;The sentiments and ideas of all the persons in the gathering take one and the same direction, and their conscious personality vanishes. A collective mind is formed, doubtless transitory, by presenting very clearly marked characteristics. The gathering has become what, in the absence of a better expression, I will call an organized crowd, or, if the term be considered preferable, a psychological crowd. It forms a single being, and is subjected to the law of the mental unity of crowds.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. The most striking peculiarity presented by a psychological crowd is the following: Whoever be the individuals that compose it, however like or unlike be their mode of life, their occupation, their character, or their intelligence, the fact that they have been transformed into a crowd puts them in possession of a sort of collective mind which makes them feel, think and act in a manner quite different from that in which each individual of them would feel, think and act were he in a state of isolation. There are certain ideas and feelings which do not come into being, or do not transform themselves into acts, except in the case of the individuals forming a crowd.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. In crowds it is stupidity and not mother wit that is accumulated. In the collective mind the intellectual aptitudes of the individuals, and in consequence their individuality, is weakened.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. The most careful observations seem to prove that an individual immerged for some length of time in a crowd in action soon finds himself in a special state, which most resembles the state of fascination in which the hypnotized individual finds himself.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. The conscious personality has entirely vanished, will and discernment are lost. All feelings and thoughts are bent in the direction determined by the hypnotizer.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. Under the influence of a suggestion he will undertake the accomplishment of certain acts with irresistible impetuosity. This impetuosity is the more irresistible in the case of crowds, from the fact that, the suggestion being the same for all the individuals of the crowd, it gains in strength by reciprocity. Moreover, by the mere fact that he forms part of an organized crowd, a man descends several rungs in the ladder of civilization. Isolated, he may be a cultured individual; in a crowd, he is a barbarian&#x2014;that is, a creature acting by instinct. He possesses the spontaneity, the violence, the ferocity, and also the enthusiasm and heroism of primitive beings, whom he further tends to resemble by the facility with which he allows himself to be induced to commit acts contrary to his most obvious interests and his best known habits. An individual in a crowd is a grain of sand amid other grains of sand, which the wind stirs up at will.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iduy9jjeoo6">Professor Davenport, in his Primitive Traits in Religious Revivals, says:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idlqwjktsf5">&#x201C;The mind of the crowd is strangely like that of primitive man. Most of the people in it may be far from primitive in emotion, in thought, in character; nevertheless, the result tends always to be the same. Stimulation immediately begets action. Reason is in abeyance. The cool, rational speaker has little chance beside the skillful emotional orator. The crowd thinks in images, and speech must take this form to be accessible to it. The images are not connected by any natural bond, and they take each other&#x2019;s place like the slides of a magic lantern. It follows from this, of course, that appeals to the imagination have paramount influence.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. The crowd is united and governed by emotion rather than by reason. Emotion is the natural bond, for men differ much less in this respect than in intellect. It is also true that in a crowd of a thousand men the amount of emotion actually generated and existing is far greater than the sum which might conceivably be obtained by adding together the emotions of the individuals taken by themselves. The explanation of this is that the attention of the crowd is always directed either by the circumstances of the occasion or by the speaker to certain common ideas&#x2014;as &#x2018;salvation&#x2019; in religious gatherings&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. and every individual in the gathering is stirred with emotion, not only because the idea or the shibboleth stirs him, but also because he is conscious that every other individual in the gathering believes in the idea or the shibboleth, and is stirred by it, too. And this enormously increases the volume of his own emotion and consequently the total volume of emotion in the crowd. As in the case of the primitive mind, imagination has unlocked the floodgates of emotion, which on occasion may become wild enthusiasm or demoniac frenzy.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idyfg455obq">The student of suggestion will see that not only are the emotional members of a revival audience subject to the effect of the &#x201C;composite-mindedness&#x201D; arising from the &#x201C;psychology of the crowd&#x201D; and are thereby weakened in resistive power, but that they are also brought under the influence of two other very potent forms of mental suggestion. Added to the powerful suggestion of authority exercised by the revivalist, which is exerted to its fullest along lines very similar to that of the professional hypnotist, is the suggestion of imitation exerted upon each individual by the combined force of the balance of the crowd.</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="id70qe6wf3u">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="id5i4bkxa5n">Some men are successful as long as someone else stands back of them and encourages them, and some men are successful in spite of Hell! Take your choice.</p><p class="ENDEND" id="idq1gj9jsfo">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idn4ts5ihi3">As Durkheim observed in his psychological investigations, the average individual is &#x201C;intimidated by the mass&#x201D; of the crowd around him, or before him, and experiences that peculiar psychological influence exerted by the mere number of people as against his individual self. Not only does the suggestible person find it easy to respond to the authoritative suggestions of the preacher and the exhortations of his helpers, but he is also brought under the direct fire of the imitative suggestions of those on all sides who are experiencing emotional activities and who are manifesting them outwardly. Not only does the voice of the shepherd urge forward, but the tinkle of the bellwether&#x2019;s bell is also heard, and the imitative tendency of the flock, which causes one sheep to jump because one ahead of him does so (and so on until the last sheep has jumped), needs but the force of the example of a leader to start into motion the entire flock. This is not an exaggeration&#x2014;human beings, in times of panic, fright, or deep emotion of any kind, manifest the imitative tendency of the sheep, and the tendency of cattle and horses to &#x201C;stampede&#x201D; under imitation.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ido2st9tboi">To the student experienced in the experimental work of the psychological laboratory there is the very closest analogy observed in the respective phenomena of the revival and hypnotic suggestion. In both cases the attention and interest is attracted by the unusual procedure; the element of mystery and awe is induced by words and actions calculated to inspire them; the senses are tired by monotonous talk in an impressive and authoritative tone; and finally the suggestions are projected in a commanding, <span class="itali">suggestive</span> manner familiar to all students of hypnotic suggestion. The subjects in both cases are prepared for the final suggestions and commands, by previously given minor suggestions, such as: &#x201C;Stand up,&#x201D; or &#x201C;Look this way,&#x201D; etc., in the case of the hypnotist; and by: &#x201C;All those who think so-and-so, stand up,&#x201D; and &#x201C;All who are willing to become better, stand up,&#x201D; etc., in the case of the revivalist. The impressionable subjects <span class="itali">are thus accustomed to obedience to suggestion by easy stages. </span>And, finally, the commanding suggestion: &#x201C;Come right up&#x2014;<span class="itali">right up&#x2014;this way&#x2014;right up&#x2014;come,</span> I say, come, <span class="itali">come, </span><span class="smallcapssc">come</span>!&#x201D; etc., which takes the impressed ones right off their feet and rushes them to the front, are almost precisely the same in the hypnotic experiment or s&#xE9;ance, on the one hand, and the sensational revival, on the other. Every good revivalist would make a good hypnotic operator, and every good hypnotic operator would make a good revivalist if his mind were turned in that direction.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idlm58kvwvf">In the revival, the person giving the suggestions has the advantage of breaking down the resistance of his audience by arousing their sentiments and emotions. Tales depicting the influence of mother, home and heaven; songs like &#x201C;Tell Mother, I&#x2019;ll Be There&#x201D;; and personal appeals to the revered associations of one&#x2019;s past and early life tend to reduce one to the state of emotional response, and render him most susceptible to strong, repeated suggestions along the same line. Young people and hysterical women are especially susceptible to this form of emotional suggestion. Their feelings are stirred, and the will is influenced by the preaching, the songs, and the personal appeals of the co-workers of the revivalist.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idilh2wpwxj">The most sacred sentimental memories are reawakened for the moment and old conditions of mind are reinduced. &#x201C;Where Is My Wandering Boy Tonight?&#x201D; brings forth tears to many a one to whom the memory of the mother is sacred, and the preaching that the mother is dwelling in a state of bliss beyond the skies, from which the unconverted child is cut off unless he professes faith, serves to move many to action for the time being. The element of fear is also invoked in the revival&#x2014;not so much as formerly, it is true, but still to a considerable extent and more subtly. The fear of a sudden death in an unconverted condition is held over the audience, and, &#x201C;Why not <span class="itali">now</span>&#x2014;why not <span class="itali">tonight?&#x201D;</span> is asked him, accompanied by the hymn; &#x201C;Oh, Why Do You Wait, Dear Brother?&#x201D; As Davenport says:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idmagqn92rp">&#x201C;It is well known that the employment of symbolic images immensely increases the emotion of an audience. The vocabulary of revivals abounds in them&#x2014;the cross, the crown, the angel band, hell, heaven. Now vivid imagination and strong feeling and belief are states of mind favorable to suggestion as well as to impulsive action. It is also true that the influence of a crowd largely in sympathy with the ideas suggested is thoroughly coercive or intimidative upon the individual sinner. There is considerable professed conversion which results in the beginning from little more than this form of social pressure, and which may never develop beyond it. Finally, the inhibition of all extraneous ideas is encouraged in revival assemblies both by prayer and speech. There is, therefore, extreme sensitiveness to suggestion. When to these conditions of negative consciousness on the part of an audience there has been added a conductor of the meetings who has a high hypnotic potential, such as Wesley or Finney, or who is only a thoroughly persuasive and magnetic personality, such as Whitefield, there may easily be an influence exerted upon certain individuals of a crowd which closely approaches the abnormal or thoroughly hypnotic. When this point is not reached there is still a great amount of highly acute though normal suggestibility to be reckoned with.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id4nxe23ole">The persons who show signs of being influenced are then &#x201C;labored with&#x201D; by either the revivalist or his co-workers. They are urged to surrender their will, and &#x201C;Leave it all to the Lord.&#x201D; They are told to &#x201C;Give yourself to God, now, right now, this minute&#x201D;; or to &#x201C;Only believe now, and you shall be saved&#x201D;; or, &#x201C;Won&#x2019;t you give yourself to Jesus?&#x201D; etc. They are exhorted and prayed with; arms are placed around their shoulders, and every art of emotional persuasive suggestion is used to make the sinner &#x201C;give up.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idq5d1tphx2">Starbuck in his The Psychology of Religion relates a number of instances of the experiences of converted persons at revivals. One person wrote as follows:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idzk5situ5j">&#x201C;My will seemed wholly at the mercy of others, particularly of the revivalist M&#x2014;&#x2014;. There was absolutely no intellectual element. It was pure feeling. There followed a period of ecstasy. I was bent on doing good and was eloquent in appealing to others. The state of moral exaltation did not continue. It was followed by a complete relapse from orthodox religion.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id87v42a1n8">Davenport has the following to say in reply to the claim that the old methods of influencing converts at a revival have passed away with the crude theology of the past:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idj5yno7foo">&#x201C;I lay particular stress upon this matter here, because, while the employment of irrational fear in revivals has largely passed away, the employment of the hypnotic method has not passed away. There has rather been a recrudescence and a conscious strengthening of it because the old prop of terror is gone. And it cannot be too vigorously emphasized that such a force is not a &#x2018;spiritual&#x2019; force in any high and clear sense at all, but is rather uncanny and psychic and obscure. And the method itself needs to be greatly refined before it can ever be of any spiritual benefit whatever. It is thoroughly primitive and belongs with the animal and instinctive means of fascination. In this bald, crude form, the feline employs it upon the helpless bird and the Indian medicine-man upon the ghost-dance votary. When used, as it has often been, upon little children who are naturally highly suggestible, it has no justification whatever and is mentally and morally injurious in the highest degree. I do not see how violent emotional throes and the use of suggestion in its crude forms can be made serviceable even in the cases of hardened sinners, and certainly with large classes of the population the employment of this means is nothing but psychological malpractice. We guard with intelligent care against quackery in physiological obstetrics. It would be well if a sterner training and prohibition hedged about the spiritual obstetrician, whose function it is to guide the far more delicate process of the new birth.&#x201D;</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="id892ygoibc">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="idh9vek5bk0">You need have no fear of competition from the person who says, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not paid to do this and I&#x2019;ll not do it.&#x201D; He will never be a dangerous competitor for your job. But watch out for the fellow who remains at his work until it is finished and performs a little more than is expected of him, for he may challenge you at the post and pass you at the grand-stand.</p><p class="ENDEND" id="idlomhmnlwg">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id89pt77vkm">Some who favor the methods of the revival, but who also recognize the fact that mental suggestion plays a most important part in the phenomena thereof, hold that the objections similar to those here advanced are not valid against the methods of the revival, inasmuch as mental suggestion, as is well known, <span class="itali">may be used for good purposes as well as bad</span>&#x2014;for the benefit and uplifting of people as well as in the opposite direction. This being admitted, these good folks argue that mental suggestion in the revival is a legitimate method or &#x201C;weapon of attack upon the stronghold of the devil.&#x201D; But this argument is found to be defective when examined in its effects and consequences. In the first place, it would seem to identify the emotional, neurotic and hysterical mental states induced by revival methods with the spiritual uplift and moral regeneration which is the accompaniment of true religious experience. It seeks to place the counterfeit on a par with the genuine&#x2014;the baleful glare of the rays of the psychic moon with the invigorating and animating rays of the spiritual sun. It seeks to raise the hypnotic phase to that of the &#x201C;spiritual-mindedness&#x201D; of man. To those who are familiar with the two classes of phenomena, there is a difference as wide as that between the poles existing between them.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idm6wj64ybf">As a straw showing how the wind of the best modern religious thought is blowing, we submit the following, from the volume entitled Religion and Miracle, from the pen of Rev. Dr. George A. Gordon, pastor emeritus of the New Old South Church of Boston:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idyfn3by1cf">&#x201C;For this end professional revivalism, with its organizations, its staff of reporters who make the figures suit the hopes of good men, the system of advertisements, and the exclusion or suppression of all sound critical comment, the appeals to emotion and the use of means which have no visible connection with grace and cannot by any possibility lead to glory, is utterly inadequate. The world waits for the vision, the passion, the simplicity and the stern truthfulness of the Hebrew prophet; it awaits the imperial breadth and moral energy of the Christian apostle to the nations; it awaits the teacher who, like Christ, shall carry his doctrine in a great mind and a great character.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id7or67sjas">While there have undoubtedly been many instances of persons attracted originally by the emotional excitement of the revival, and afterwards leading worthy religious lives in accordance with the higher spiritual nature, still in too many cases the revival has exerted but a temporary effect for good upon the persons yielding to the excitement, and after the stress has passed has resulted in creating an indifference and even an aversion for true religious feeling. The reaction is often equal to the original action. The consequences of &#x201C;backsliding&#x201D; are well known in all churches, after a spirited revival. In others there is merely awakened a susceptibility to emotional excitement, which causes the individual to undergo repeated stages of &#x201C;conversion&#x201D; at each revival, and a subsequent &#x201C;backsliding&#x201D; after the influence of the meeting is withdrawn.</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="idxe4455kwh">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="idk14wjclyx">Until you have learned to be tolerant with those who do not always agree with you&#x2014;until you have cultivated the habit of saying some kind word of those whom you do not admire&#x2014;until you have formed the habit of looking for the good instead of the bad there is in others, you will be neither successful nor happy.</p><p class="ENDEND" id="id198k7wrf0">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idbpvqub7rx">Moreover, it is a fact known to psychologists that persons who have given way to the emotional excitement and excesses of the typical revival are rendered afterwards far more suggestible and open to &#x201C;isms,&#x201D; fads and false religions than before. <span class="itali">The people flocking to the support of the various pseudo-religious adventurers and impostors of the age are generally found to be the same people who were previously the most ardent and excitable converts of the revival.</span> The ranks of the &#x201C;Messiahs,&#x201D; &#x201C;Elijahs&#x201D; and &#x201C;Prophets of the Dawn,&#x201D; who have appeared in great numbers in this country and England during the past fifty years, have been recruited almost exclusively from those who have previously &#x201C;experienced&#x201D; the revival fervor in the orthodox churches. It is the old story of the training of the hypnotic subject. Especially harmful is this form of emotional intoxication among young people and women. It must be remembered that the period of adolescence is one in which the mental nature of the individual is undergoing great changes. It is a period noted for peculiar development of the emotional nature, the sex nature, and the religious nature. The existing conditions at this period render the psychic debauchery of the revival, s&#xE9;ance or hypnotic exhibition particularly harmful. Excessive emotional excitement, coupled with mystery, fear and awe, at this period of life, often results in morbid and abnormal conditions arising in after life. As Davenport well says: &#x201C;It is no time for the shock of fear or the agony of remorse. The only result of such misguided religious zeal is likely to be a strengthening in many cases of those tendencies, especially in females, toward morbidity and hysteria, toward darkness and doubt.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idmuv93ak01">There are other facts connected with the close relation existing between abnormal religious excitement and the undue arousing of the sexual nature, which are well known to all students of the subject, but which cannot be spoken of here. As a hint, however, the following, from Davenport, will serve its purpose: &#x201C;. . .At the age of puberty there is an organic process at work which pushes into activity at nearly the same time the sexual and the spiritual. There is no proof, however, of the causation of the latter by the former. But it does appear to be true that the two are closely associated at the point in the physical process where they branch in different directions, <span class="itali">that at that critical period any radical excitation of the one has its influence upon the other</span>.&#x201D; A careful consideration of this important statement will serve to explain many things that have sorely perplexed many good people in the past, in connection with revival excitement in a town, camp meetings, etc. This apparent influence of the devil, which so worried our forefathers, is seen to be but the operation of natural psychological and physiological laws. To understand it is to have the remedy at hand.&#x201D;</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="idulmwfu6m1">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="id4l4jcp7yn">If you hesitate or turn backward while under fire, you&#x2019;re not a Fighter&#x2014;you&#x2019;re a &#x201C;Quitter&#x201D;; and the Devil, himself, hates the person with a rubber backbone. He smells bad burning.</p><p class="ENDEND" id="idfcm5smnw9">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id0pdg5a0zx">But what do the authorities say of the revival of the future&#x2014;the new revival&#x2014;the real revival? Let Professor Davenport speak for the critics&#x2014;he is well adapted for the task. He says:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idvvqamjy3p">&#x201C;There will be, I believe, far less use of the revival meeting as a crass coercive instrument for overriding the will and overwhelming the reason of the individual man. The influence of public religious gatherings will be more indirect, more unobtrusive. It will be recognized that hypnotization and forced choices weaken the soul, and there will be no attempt to press to decision in so great a matter under the spell of excitement and contagion and suggestion.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. The converts may be few. They may be many. They will be measured, not by the capacity of the preacher for administrative hypnotism, but rather by the capacity for unselfish friendship of every Christian man and woman. But of this I think we may be confident&#x2014;the days of religious effervescence and passional unrestraint are dying. The days of intelligent, undemonstrative and self-sacrificing piety are dawning. To do justly, to love mercy, to walk humbly with God&#x2014;these remain the cardinal tests of the divine in man.&#xA0;.&#xA0;.&#xA0;. Religious experience is an evolution. We go on from the rudimentary and the primitive to the rational and the spiritual. And, believe Paul, the mature fruit of the Spirit is not the subliminal uprush, the lapse of inhibition, but rational love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, meekness&#x2014;self-control.&#x201D;</p><p class="Blank-Space-BreakBsbrk" id="idqxuc0o6bu">[blank]</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idnzvfhnnnu">The Law of Concentration is one of the major principles which must be understood and applied intelligently by all who would successfully experiment with the principle described in this course as the &#x201C;Master Mind.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idgikisrzck">The foregoing comments, by leading authorities of the world, will give you a better understanding of the Law of Concentration as it is often used by those who wish to &#x201C;blend&#x201D; or &#x201C;fuse&#x201D; the minds of a crowd so they will function as a single mind.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id4vc8db8p3">You are now ready for the lesson on Co-operation, which will take you further into the methods of applying the psychological laws upon which this philosophy of success is based.</p><p class="Section-ChapterSCP" id="idla68atigm">Epigraph</p><p class="Design-NoteDn" id="idpi0hc9izm">DES: set this epigraph on its own page</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="id4yux1lty8">You have failed many times?

This system has its center in the brain, while the other has its center in the ganglionic mass at the back of the stomach known as the solar plexus, and sometimes spoken of as the abdominal brain. The cerebro-spinal system is the channel of our volitional or conscious mental action, and the sympathetic system is the channel of that mental action which unconsciously supports the vital functions of the body.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ida2ncs1c12">&#x201C;Thus the cerebro-spinal system is the organ of the conscious mind and the sympathetic is that of the sub-conscious mind.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idevbrv8mmv">&#x201C;But the interaction of conscious and sub-conscious minds requires a similar interaction between the corresponding systems of nerves, and one conspicuous connection by which this is provided is the &#x201C;vagus&#x201D; nerve. This nerve passes out of the cerebral region as a portion of the voluntary system, and through it we control the vocal organs; then it passes onward to the thorax, sending out branches to the heart and lungs; and finally, passing through the diaphragm, it loses the outer coating which distinguishes the nerves of the voluntary system and becomes identified with those of the sympathetic system, <span class="itali">so forming a connecting link </span>between the two and making the man physically a single entity.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idztpao6b1e">&#x201C;Similarly different areas of the brain indicate their connection with the objective and subjective activities of the mind respectively, and, speaking in a general way, we may assign the frontal portion of the brain to the former, and the posterior portion to the latter, while the intermediate portion partakes of the character of both.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idxpwkxicqb">&#x201C;The intuitional faculty has its correspondence in the upper area of the brain, situated between the frontal and the posterior portions, and, physiologically speaking, it is here that intuitive ideas find entrance. These, at first, are more or less unformed and generalized in character, but are, nevertheless, perceived by the conscious mind; otherwise, we should not be aware of them at all. Then the effort of Nature is to bring these ideas into more definite and usable shape, so the conscious mind lays hold on them and induces a corresponding vibratory current in the voluntary system of nerves, and this in turn induces a similar current in the involuntary system, <span class="itali">thus handing the idea over to the subjective mind.</span> The vibratory current which had first descended from the apex of the brain to the frontal brain and thus through the voluntary system to the solar plexus is now reversed and ascends from the solar plexus through the sympathetic system to the posterior brain, this return current indicating the action of the subjective mind.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ida7f07vu97">If we were to remove the surface portion of the apex of the brain we should find immediately below it the shining belt of brain substance called the &#x201C;corpus callosum.&#x201D; <span class="itali">This is the point of union between the subjective and objective,</span> and, as the current returns from the solar plexus to this point, it is restored to the objective portion of the brain in a fresh form <span class="itali">which it has acquired by the silent alchemy of the subjective mind.</span> Thus the conception which was at first only vaguely recognized is restored to the objective mind in a definite and workable form, and then the objective mind, acting through the frontal brain&#x2014;the area of comparison and analysis&#x2014;proceeds to work upon a clearly perceived idea and to bring out the potentialities that are latent in it.<span class="custom_note_mark">*</span><span class="FootnoteReference FootnoteRef" id="footnote_4">4</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idr3yswkpp3">The term &#x201C;subjective mind&#x201D; is the same as the term &#x201C;sub-conscious mind,&#x201D; and the term &#x201C;objective mind&#x201D; is the same as the term &#x201C;conscious mind.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id7rg88jzck">Please understand these different terms.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idtgdo7kd3l">By studying this <span class="itali">dual system</span> through which the body transmits energy, we discover the exact points at which the two systems are connected, and the manner in which we may transmit a <span class="itali">thought</span> from the conscious to the sub-conscious mind.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idvb0in0idl">This Co-operative <span class="itali">dual nervous system</span> is the most important form of co-operation known to man; for it is through the aid of this system that the principle of evolution carries on its work of developing <span class="itali">accurate thought,</span> as described in Lesson Ten.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idphtmbxoxg">When you impress any idea on your sub-conscious mind, through the principle of Autosuggestion, you do so with the aid of this <span class="itali">dual nervous system:</span> and when your sub-conscious mind works out a definite plan of any <span class="itali">desire</span> with which you impress it, the plan is delivered back to your conscious mind through this same <span class="itali">dual nervous system.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idq9ld6livm">This Co-operative system of nerves literally constitutes a direct line of communication between your ordinary conscious mind and <span class="itali">infinite intelligence.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idxwik6cju9">Knowing, from my own previous experience as a beginner in the study of this subject, how difficult it is to accept the hypothesis here described, I will illustrate the soundness of the hypothesis in a simple way that you can both understand and demonstrate for yourself.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idfxqsszgn0">Before going to sleep at night impress upon your mind the <span class="itali">desire</span> to arise the next morning at a given hour, say at four A.M., and if your impression is accompanied by a <span class="itali">positive determination</span> to arise at that hour, your sub-conscious mind will register the impression and awaken you at precisely that time.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idjcoabd7ur">Now the question might well be asked:</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="id0g2520uzo">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="id4f2wefu6g">You cannot scare a man who is at peace with God, his fellow men and himself There is no room for fear in such a man&#x2019;s heart.

Henry Ford&#x2019;s most tangible asset is the well organized agency force that he has established.

Personal power is developed by developing, organizing and co-ordinating the faculties of the mind. This may be accomplished by mastering and applying the fifteen major principles upon which this course is founded. The necessary procedure through which these principles may be mastered is thoroughly described in the fifteenth lesson.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idroiht5rbk">The development of personal power is but the first step to be taken in the development of the potential power that is available through the medium of allied effort, or <span class="itali">co-operation, </span>which may be called group power.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idljvw6h5lw">It is a well known fact that all men who have amassed large fortunes have been known as able &#x201C;organizers.&#x201D; By this is meant that they possessed the ability to enlist the co-operative efforts of other men who supplied talent and ability which they, themselves, did not possess.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idayx3rggch">The chief object of this course is so to unfold the principles of <span class="itali">organized</span> and <span class="itali">co-operative </span>or allied effort that the student will comprehend their significance and make them the basis of his philosophy.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2okxatsa9">Take, as an example, any business or profession that you choose and you will observe, by analysis, that it is limited only by lack of application of <span class="itali">organized</span> and <span class="itali">co-operative</span> effort. As an illustration, consider the legal profession.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idbtthc9nqe">If a law firm consists of but one type of mind it will be greatly handicapped, even though it may be made up of a dozen able men of this particular type. The complicated legal system calls for a greater variety of talent than any one man could possibly provide.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id8ab38gvz5">It is evident, therefore, that mere organized effort is not sufficient to insure outstanding success; the organization must consist of individuals each of whom supplies some specialized talent which the other members of the organization do not possess.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id3vyuupjas">A well organized law firm would include talent that was specialized in the preparation of cases; men of vision and imagination who understood how to harmonize the law and the evidence of a case under a sound plan. Men who have such ability are not always possessed of the ability to try a case in court; therefore, men who are proficient in court procedure must be available. Carrying the analysis a step further, it will be seen that there are many different classes of cases which call for men of various types of specialized ability in both the preparation and the trial of these cases. A lawyer who had prepared himself as a specialist in corporation law might be wholly unprepared to handle a case in criminal procedure.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idnyi3hhbhe">In forming a law partnership, the man who understood the principles of <span class="itali">organized, </span><span class="itali">cooperative</span><span class="itali"> effort,</span> would surround himself with talent that was specialized in every branch of law and legal procedure in which he intended to practice. The man who had no conception of the potential power of these principles would probably select his associates by the usual &#x201C;hit or miss&#x201D; method, basing his selections more upon personality or acquaintanceship than consideration of the particular type of legal talent that each possessed.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idzyknlpy99">The subject of <span class="itali">organized effort</span> has been covered in the preceding lessons of this course, but it is again brought up in connection with this lesson for the purpose of indicating the necessity of forming alliances or organizations consisting of individuals who supply <span class="itali">all of the necessary talent that may be needed for the attainment of the object in mind.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddg53vdvwu">In nearly all commercial undertakings, there is a need for at least three classes of talent; namely, buyers, salesmen and those who are familiar with finance. It will be readily seen that when these three classes of men <span class="itali">organize</span> and <span class="itali">co-ordinate</span> their efforts they avail themselves, through this form of <span class="itali">co-operation,</span> of <span class="itali">power</span> which no single individual of the group possesses.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idmoihd8ri3">Many a business fails because all of the men back of it are salesmen, or financial men or buyers. By nature, the most able salesmen are optimistic, enthusiastic and emotional; while able financial men, as a rule, are unemotional, deliberate and conservative. Both classes are essential to the success of a commercial enterprise; but either class will prove too much of a load for any business, without the modifying influence of the other class.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9w98r54i3">It is generally conceded that James J. Hill was the most efficient railroad builder that America ever produced; but it is equally well known that he was not a civil engineer, nor a bridge builder, nor a locomotive engineer, nor a mechanical engineer, nor a chemist, although these highly specialized classes of talent are essential in railroad building. Mr. Hill understood the principles of <span class="itali">organized effort</span> and <span class="itali">co-operation; </span>therefore, he surrounded himself with men who possessed all this necessary ability which he lacked.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idk0kb07vzp">The modern department store is a splendid example of <span class="itali">organized, co-operative effort.</span></p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="ideznqfdbqw">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="id42oenhd56">A good stock of self-confidence and a new suit of clothes will help you land a position without &#x201C;pull,&#x201D; but remember that nothing will go so far toward helping you hold it as will push, enthusiasm and determination to do more than that for which you are paid.</p><p class="ENDEND" id="ido9bby7nf7">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id877nt8g37">Each merchandising department is under the management of one who understands the purchasing and marketing of the goods carried in that department.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9b0bg7351">Back of all these department managers is a general staff consisting of specialists in buying, selling, financing, and the management of units, or groups, of people. This form of <span class="itali">organized effort</span> places back of each department both <span class="itali">buying</span> and <span class="itali">selling </span>power such as that department could not afford if it were separated from the group and had to be operated under its own overhead, in a separate location.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idk13ctl1xs">The United States of America is one of the richest and most <span class="itali">powerful</span> nations of the world. Upon analysis, it will be seen that this enormous power has grown out of the <span class="itali">co-operative</span> efforts of the states of the Union.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id3uwdsmfgb">It was for the purpose of saving this power that the immortal Lincoln made up his mind to erase the Mason and Dixon line. The saving of the Union was of far greater concern to him than was the freedom of the slaves of the South. Had this not been so, the present status of the United States as a power among the nations of the world would be far different from what it is.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idxvtj4lamv">It was this same principle of <span class="itali">co-operative</span> effort that Woodrow Wilson had in mind when he created his plan for a League of Nations. He foresaw the need of such a plan as a medium for preventing war between nations; just as Lincoln foresaw it as a medium for harmonizing the efforts of the people of the United States, thereby preserving the Union.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idhyhcfe3a4">Thus it is seen that the principle of <span class="itali">organized, co-operative</span> effort through the aid of which the individual may develop personal power, is the selfsame principle that must be employed in developing group power.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idesc4yrwf4">Andrew Carnegie easily dominated the steel business during his active connection with that industry, for the reason that he took advantage of the principle of <span class="itali">organized, co-operative </span>effort by surrounding himself with highly specialized financial men, chemists, sales managers, buyers of raw materials, transportation experts and others whose services were essential to that industry. He organized this group of <span class="itali">&#x201C;co-operators&#x201D;</span> into what he called a &#x201C;Master Mind.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id85gqiwtxh">Any great university affords an excellent example of the necessity of <span class="itali">organized, co-operative </span>effort. The professorate is made up of men and women of highly specialized, though vastly different, ability. One department is presided over by experts in literature; another department by expert mathematicians; another department by experts in chemistry; another department by experts in economic philosophy; another department by experts in medicine; another, by experts in law, etc. The university, as a whole, is the equivalent of a group of colleges each of which is directed by experts in its own line, whose efficiency is greatly increased through allied or <span class="itali">co-operative</span> effort that is directed by a single head.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1sv0g5tof">Analyze <span class="itali">power,</span> no matter where, or in what form, it may be found, and you will find <span class="itali">organization</span> and <span class="itali">co-operation</span> as the chief factors back of it.

While there, I observed many sons of &#x201C;first families&#x201D;&#x2014;some of whom were equipped with Packards. Twenty years ago I would have felt proud to be a student at Harvard, with a Packard car, but the illuminating effect of my more mature years has led me to the conclusion that had I had the privilege of going to Harvard I might have done just as well without the aid of a Packard.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idcuz0jvd0u">I noticed some Harvard boys who had no Packards. They were working as waiters in a restaurant where I ate, and as far as I could see they were missing nothing of value because they owned no Packards; nor did they seem to be suffering by comparison with those who could boast of the ownership of parents of the &#x201C;first family&#x201D; type.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idvd9unwaav">All of which is no reflection upon Harvard University&#x2014;one of the great universities of the world&#x2014;nor upon the &#x201C;first families&#x201D; who send boys to Harvard. To the contrary, it is intended as a bit of encouragement to those unfortunates who, like myself, have but little and know but little, but express what little they know in terms of constructive, useful <span class="itali">action.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idgs28sdly3">The psychology of <span class="itali">inaction</span> is one of the chief reasons why some towns and cities are dying with the dry-rot!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idwmayh3krf">Take the city of X, for example. You&#x2019;ll recognize the city by its description, if you are familiar with this part of the country. Sunday blue-laws have closed up all the restaurants on Sunday. Railroad trains must slow down to twelve miles an hour while passing through the city. &#x201C;Keep off the grass&#x201D; signs are prominently displayed in the parks. Unfavorable city ordinances of one sort or another have driven the best industries to other cities. On every hand one may see evidence of restraint. The people of the streets show signs of restraint in their faces, and in their manner, and in their walk.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idy1x3nv8k6">The mass psychology of the city is negative.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id82xc3606r">The moment one gets off the train at the depot, this negative atmosphere becomes depressingly obvious and makes one want to take the next train out again. The place reminds one of a grave-yard and the people resemble walking ghosts.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idh0qv80ed2">They register no signs of <span class="itali">action!</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idz16dqvymc">The bank statements of the banking institutions reflect this negative, <span class="itali">inactive</span> state of mind. The stores reflect it in their show windows and in the faces of their salespeople. I went into one of the stores to buy a pair of hose. A young woman with bobbed hair who would have been a &#x201C;flapper&#x201D; if she hadn&#x2019;t been too lazy, threw out a box of hose on the counter. When I picked up the box, looked the hose over and registered a look of disapproval on my face, she languidly yawned:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2sadh2uli">&#x201C;They&#x2019;re the best you can get in this dump!&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idnj2oa0ilz"><span class="itali">&#x201C;Dump!&#x201D;</span> She must have been a mind reader, for &#x201C;dump&#x201D; was the word that was in my mind before she spoke. The store reminded me of a rubbish dump; the city reminded me of the same. I felt the stuff getting into my own blood. The negative psychology of the people was actually reaching out and gathering me in.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idmjm466qcb">Maine is not the only state that is afflicted with a city such as the one I have described. I could name others, but I might wish to go into politics some day; therefore, I will leave it to you to do your own analyzing and comparing of cities that are alive with <span class="itali">action</span> and those that are slowly dying with the dry-rot of <span class="itali">inaction.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id142cr5ojm">I know of some business concerns that are in this same state of <span class="itali">inaction,</span> but I will omit their names. You probably know some, too.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idrd737l6yr">Many years ago Frank A. Vanderlip, who is one of the best known and most capable bankers in America, went to work for the National City Bank, of New York City.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddw4xmscya">His salary was above the average from the start, for the reason that he was capable and had a record of successful achievement that made him a valuable man.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idriku6l2y3">He was assigned to a private office that was equipped with a fine mahogany desk and an easy chair. On the top of the desk was an electric push button that led to a secretary&#x2019;s desk outside.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idh4p4budvk">The first day went by without any work coming to his desk. The second, and third, and fourth days went by without any work. No one came in or said anything to him.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idsnmyrlfkp">By the end of the week he began to feel uneasy. (Men of <span class="itali">action</span> always feel uneasy when there is no work in sight.)</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id8ge0ixlze">The following week Mr. Vanderlip went into the president&#x2019;s office and said, &#x201C;Look here, you are paying me a big salary and giving me nothing to do and it is grating on my nerves!&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9e4psj4oc">The president looked up with a lively twinkle in his keen eyes.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id7024el78x">&#x201C;Now I have been thinking,&#x201D; Mr. Vanderlip continued, &#x201C;while sitting in there with nothing to do, of a plan for increasing the business of this bank.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idkyyoldyr6">The president assured him that both &#x201C;thinking&#x201D; and &#x201C;plans&#x201D; were valuable, and asked him to continue with his interview.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2t6ymj7s8">&#x201C;I have thought of a plan,&#x201D; Mr. Vanderlip went on, &#x201C;that will give the bank the benefit of my experience in the bond business. I propose to create a bond department for this bank and advertise it as a feature of our business.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2y9ffxthx">&#x201C;What! this bank advertise?&#x201D; queried the president. &#x201C;Why, we have never advertised since we began business. We have managed to get along without it.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idei8826qqy">&#x201C;Well, this is where you are going to begin advertising,&#x201D; said Mr. Vanderlip, &#x201C;and the first thing you are going to advertise is this new bond department that I have planned.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idqeo7k7kk4">Mr. Vanderlip won! Men of <span class="itali">action</span> usually win&#x2014;that is one of their distinctive features. The National City Bank also won, because that interview was the beginning of one of the most progressive and profitable advertising campaigns ever carried on by any bank, with the result that the National City Bank became one of the most powerful financial institutions of America.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idubf3ut3zl">There were other results, also, that are worth naming. Among them the result that Mr. Vanderlip grew with the bank, as men of <span class="itali">action</span> usually grow in whatever they help to build, until finally he became the president of that great banking house.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idybddmkgki">In the lesson on <span class="itali">Imagination</span> you learned how to recombine old ideas into new plans, but no matter how practical your plans may be they will be useless if they are not expressed in <span class="itali">action.</span> To dream dreams and see visions of the person you would like to be or the station in life you would like to obtain are admirable provided you transform your dreams and visions into reality through intensive <span class="itali">action.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id45giv7yy8">There are men who dream, but do nothing more. There are others who take the visions of the dreamers and translate them into stone, and marble, and music, and good books, and railroads, and steamships. There are still others who <span class="itali">both dream</span> and transform these dreams into reality. They are the dreamer-doer types.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idehdjgnpak">There is a psychological as well as an economic reason why you should form the habit of intensive <span class="itali">action.</span> Your body is made up of billions of tiny cells that are highly sensitive and amenable to the influence of your mind. If your mind is of the lethargic, <span class="itali">inactive</span> type, the cells of your body become lazy and inactive also. Just as the stagnant water of an inactive pond becomes impure and unhealthful, so will the cells of an inactive body become diseased.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id7p94unhw4">Laziness is nothing but the influence of an inactive mind on the cells of the body. If you doubt this, the next time you feel lazy take a Turkish bath and have yourself well rubbed down, thereby stimulating the cells of your body by artificial means, and see how quickly your laziness disappears. Or, a better way than this, turn your mind toward some game of which you are fond and notice how quickly the cells of your body will respond to your enthusiasm and your lazy feeling will disappear.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idheadqpdfe">The cells of the body respond to the state of mind in exactly the same manner that the people of a city respond to the mass psychology that dominates the city. If a group of leaders engage in sufficient <span class="itali">action</span> to give a city the reputation of being a &#x201C;live-wire&#x201D; city this <span class="itali">action</span> influences all who live there. The same principle applies to the relationship between the mind and the body. An <span class="itali">active,</span> dynamic mind keeps the cells of which the physical portions of the body consist, in a constant state of activity.</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="idrfm4iwi8e">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="ideu2o5eoql">Every failure will teach you a lesson that you need to learn if you will keep your eyes and ears open and be willing to be taught.

Most headaches may be cured in an hour&#x2019;s time by simply cleansing the lower intestines with an enema.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2j257lagi">Eight glasses of water a day and a reasonable amount of physical <span class="itali">action</span> popularly known as &#x201C;exercise&#x201D; will take the place of the enema. Try it for a week and then you will not have to be urged to keep it up, for you will feel like a new person, unless the nature of your work is such that you get plenty of physical exercise and drink plenty of water in the regular course of your duties.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idv1g9t3tas">On two pages of this book enough sound advice could be recorded to keep the average person healthy and ready for <span class="itali">action</span> during sixteen of the twenty-four hours of the day, but the advice would be so simple that most people would not follow it.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idg3gbiyfse">The amount of work that I perform every day and still keep in good physical condition is a source of wonderment and mystery to those who know me intimately, yet there is no mystery to it, and the system I follow does not cost anything.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idrvpx5leur">Here it is, for your use if you want it:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idg0ggebbhn"><span class="itali">First:</span> I drink a cup of hot water when I first get up in the morning, before I have breakfast.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id3r02fagqc"><span class="itali">Second:</span> My breakfast consists of rolls made of whole wheat and bran, breakfast cereal, fruit, softboiled eggs once in a while, and coffee. For luncheon I eat vegetables (most any kind), whole wheat bread and a glass of buttermilk. Supper, a well cooked steak once or twice a week, vegetables, especially lettuce, and coffee.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idtzl9whbxq"><span class="itali">Third:</span> I walk an average of ten miles a day: five miles into the country and five miles back, using this period for meditation and thought. Perhaps the thinking is as valuable, as a health builder, as the walk.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idaa1itcwz2"><span class="itali">Fourth:</span> I lie across a straight bottom chair, flat on my back, with most of my weight resting on the small of my back, with my head and arms relaxed completely, until they almost touch the floor. This gives the nervous energy of my body an opportunity to balance properly and distribute itself, and ten minutes in this position will completely relieve all signs of fatigue, no matter how tired I may be.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idna48d2n8u"><span class="itali">Fifth:</span> I take an enema at least once every ten days, and more often if I feel the need of it, using water that is a little below blood temperature, with a tablespoonful of salt in it, chest and knee position.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idvo8804sdu"><span class="itali">Sixth:</span> I take a hot shower bath, followed immediately by a cold shower, every day, usually in the morning when I first get up.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id50gdjlz5d">These simple things I do for myself. Mother Nature attends to everything else necessary for my health.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idtcwwuxyha">I cannot lay too much stress upon the importance of keeping the intestines clean, for it is a well known fact that the city dwellers of today are literally poisoning themselves to death by neglecting to cleanse their intestines with water. You should not wait until you are constipated to take an enema. When you get to the stage of constipation you are practically ill and immediate relief is absolutely essential, but if you will give yourself the proper attention regularly, just as you attend to keeping the outside of your body clean, you will never be bothered with the many troubles which constipation brings.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idwd5baeets">For more than fifteen years no single week ever passed without my having a headache. Usually I administered a dose of aspirin and got temporary relief. I was suffering with autointoxication and did not know it, for the reason that I was not constipated.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idqlcdgk0lc">When I found out what my trouble was I did two things, both of which I recommend to you; namely, <span class="itali">I quit using aspirin</span> and I cut down my daily consumption of food nearly one half.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idots9i5la7">Just a word about aspirin&#x2014;a word which those who profit by its sale will not like&#x2014;it affords no permanent cure of headache. All it does might be compared to a lineman that cuts the telegraph wire while the operator is using that wire in a call for aid from the fire department to save the burning building in which he is located. Aspirin cuts or &#x201C;deadens&#x201D; the line of nerve communication that runs from the stomach or the intestinal region, where autointoxication is pouring poison into the blood, to the brain, where the effect of that poison is registering its call in the form of intense pain.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idulgu1mw0j">Cutting the telegraph line over which a call for the fire department is being sent does not put out the fire; nor does it remove the cause to deaden, with the aid of a dose of aspirin, the nerve line over which a headache is registering a call for help.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idgk6l72oz1">You cannot be a person of <span class="itali">action</span> if you permit yourself to go without proper physical attention until auto-intoxication takes your brain and kneads it into an inoperative mass that resembles a ball of putty. Neither can you be a person of <span class="itali">action</span> if you eat the usual devitalized concoction called &#x201C;white bread&#x201D; (which has had all the real food value removed from it) and twice as much meat as your system can digest and properly dispose of.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idlpqnoocs7">You cannot be a person of <span class="itali">action</span> if you run to the pill bottle every time you have, or <span class="itali">imagine</span> you have, an ache or a pain, or swallow an aspirin tablet every time your intestines call on your brain for a douche bag of water and a spoonful of salt for cleansing purposes.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ida7lnhs2z4">You cannot be a person of <span class="itali">action</span> if you <span class="itali">overeat</span> and <span class="itali">under-exercise.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idyqzpo0lz7">You cannot be a person of <span class="itali">action</span> if you read the patent medicine booklets and begin to imagine yourself ailing with the symptoms described by the clever advertisement writer who has reached your pocket book through the power of <span class="itali">suggestion.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idvizpesg6y">I have not touched a drug for more than five years, and I have not been either sick or ailing during that time, in spite of the fact that I perform more work each day than most men of my profession.

In this instance, I make no stronger recommendations than this:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idp3drl8isq"><span class="itali">That you try an enema the next time you have a headache,</span> and if any of the other suggestions appeal to you give them a trial until you are satisfied that they are either sound or unsound.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idxdgt7zzss">Before leaving the subject, perhaps I should explain that water which is barely luke-warm should be used for the enema for the reason that this causes the muscles of the intestines to contract, which, in turn, forces the poisonous matter out of the pores of the mucous linings. This exercises those muscles and eventually it will so develop them that they will do their work in the natural way, without the aid of the enema. A warm water enema is very detrimental for the reason that it relaxes the muscles of the intestines, which, in time, causes them to cease functioning altogether, producing what is ordinarily referred to as the &#x201C;enema habit.&#x201D;</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="id6uxa4tmvw">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="idgbn5etmbe">An occasional misfortune is a good thing.

This interference is purely physical, but the damage does not stop here, because these negative states of mind destroy the most essential factor in the achievement of <span class="itali">success;</span> namely, <span class="itali">desire</span> to achieve.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idh73kybhjw">In the first lesson of this course you learned that your <span class="itali">definite chief aim</span> in life should be supported by a <span class="itali">burning desire</span> for its realization. You can have no <span class="itali">burning desire</span> for achievement when you are in a negative state of mind, no matter what the cause of that state of mind may be.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idkeel1r23l">To keep myself in a positive frame of mind I have discovered a very effective &#x201C;gloom-chaser.&#x201D; That may not be a very dignified way of expressing my meaning, but since the subject of this lesson is <span class="itali">action</span> and not dignity I will make it serve. The &#x201C;gloom-chaser&#x201D; to which I refer is a <span class="itali">hearty laugh.</span> When I feel &#x201C;out of sorts&#x201D; or inclined to argue with somebody over something that is not worthy of discussion, I know that I need my &#x201C;gloom-chaser,&#x201D; and I proceed to get away where I will disturb no one and have a good hearty laugh. If I can find nothing really funny about which to laugh I simply have a forced laugh. The effect is the same in both cases.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idb884bd34v">Five minutes of this sort of mental and physical exercise&#x2014;for it is both&#x2014;will stimulate <span class="itali">action</span> that is free from negative tendencies.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id245lktse7">Do not take my word for this&#x2014;try it!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idptn7oxwhn">Not long ago I heard a phonograph record entitled, as I recall it, The Laughing Fool, which should be available to all whose dignity forbids them to indulge in a hearty laugh for their health&#x2019;s sake. This record was all that its name implies. It was made by a man and a woman; the man was trying to play a cornet and the woman was laughing at him. She laughed so effectively that she finally made the man laugh, and the suggestion was so pronounced that all who heard it usually joined in and had a good laugh, whether they felt like it or not.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idyn8voca4o">&#x201C;As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id253g4ulcs">You cannot think <span class="itali">fear</span> and act courageously. You cannot think hatred and act in a kindly manner toward those with whom you associate. The dominating thoughts of your mind&#x2014;meaning by this, the strongest and deepest and most frequent of your thoughts&#x2014;influence the physical <span class="itali">action</span> of your body.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idcwkpr92kl">Every thought put into action by your brain reaches and influences every cell in your body. When you think <span class="itali">fear</span> your mind telegraphs this thought down to the cells that form the muscles of your legs and tells those muscles to get into <span class="itali">action</span> and carry you away as rapidly as they can. A man who is afraid runs away because his legs carry him, and they carry him because the <span class="itali">fear</span> thought in his mind instructed them to do so, even though the instructions were given unconsciously.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idia1e8f7s8">In the Introduction to this course you learned how <span class="itali">thought</span> travels from one mind to another, through the principle of telepathy. In this lesson you should go a step further and learn that <span class="itali">your thoughts</span> not only register themselves in the minds of other people, through the principle of telepathy, but, <span class="itali">what is a million times more important to you to understand, they register themselves on the cells of your own body</span> and <span class="itali">affect those cells in a manner that harmonizes with the nature of the thoughts.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idv6crtldw6">To understand this principle is to understand the soundness of the statement: &#x201C;As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idffdgfrt5n"><span class="itali">Action,</span> in the sense that the term is used in this lesson, is of two forms. One is physical and the other is mental. You can be very active with your mind while your body is entirely inactive, except as to the involuntary action of the vital organs. Or you can be very active with both body and mind.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ideul21kjcp">In speaking of men of <span class="itali">action,</span> either or both of two types may be referred to. One is the care-taker type and the other is the promoter or salesman type. Both of these types are essential in modern business, industry and finance. One is known as a &#x201C;dynamo&#x201D; while the other is often referred to as a &#x201C;balance wheel.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddib6s09gb">Once in a great while you will find a man who is both a dynamo and a balance wheel, but such well balanced personalities are rare. Most successful business organizations that assume great size are made up of both of these types.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2k0hq3mpr">The &#x201C;balance wheel&#x201D; who does nothing but compile facts and figures and statistics is just as much a man of <span class="itali">action</span> as the man who goes upon the platform and sells an idea to a thousand people by the sheer power of his <span class="itali">active</span> personality. To determine whether a man is a man of <span class="itali">action</span> or not it is necessary to analyze both his mental and his physical habits.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ido22wk56qu">In the first part of this lesson I said that &#x201C;the world pays you for what you do and not for what you know.&#x201D; That statement might easily be misconstrued. What the world really pays you for is <span class="itali">what you do</span> or <span class="itali">what you can get others to do.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idr48ot3puu">A man who can induce others to co-operate and do effective team-work, or inspire others so that they become more <span class="itali">active,</span> is no less a man of <span class="itali">action</span> than the man who renders effective service in a more direct manner.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idaaophyu3v">In the field of industry and business there are men who have the ability so to inspire and direct the efforts of others that all under their direction accomplish more than they could without this directing influence. It is a well known fact that Carnegie so ably directed the efforts of those who constituted his personal staff that he made many wealthy men of those who would never have become wealthy without the directing genius of his brain. The same may be said of practically all great leaders in the field of industry and business&#x2014;the gain is not all on the side of the leaders. Those under their direction often profit most by their leadership.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id97gd89fnl">It is a common practice for a certain type of man to berate his employers because of their opposite stations in a financial sense. It is usually true that such men would be infinitely worse off without these employers than they are with them.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idpu0nzew86">In the Introduction to this course the value of allied effort was particularly emphasized for the reason that some men have the vision to plan while others have the ability to carry plans into <span class="itali">action</span> although they do not possess the <span class="itali">imagination</span> or the vision to create the plans they execute.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idof0bas16g">It was his understanding of this principle of allied effort that enabled Andrew Carnegie to surround himself with a group of men that was made up of those who could plan and those who could execute. Carnegie had in his group of assistants some of the most efficient salesmen in the world, but if his entire staff had been made up of men who could do nothing but sell he could never have accumulated the fortune that he did. If his entire staff had been made up of salesmen only he would have had <span class="itali">action</span> in abundance, but <span class="itali">action,</span> in the sense that it is used in this lesson, must be intelligently guided.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id3b9qfar0o">One of the best known law firms in America is made up of two lawyers, one of whom never appears in court.

The promoter type makes an able salesman and organizer. The care-taker type makes an excellent conserver of assets after they have been accumulated.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idn38bdxmvo">Place the care-taker type in charge of a set of books and he is happy, but place him on the outside selling and he is unhappy and will be a failure at his job. Place the promoter in charge of a set of books and he will be miserable. His nature demands more intense <span class="itali">action.</span> Action of the passive type will not satisfy his ambitions, and if he is kept at work which does not give him the action his nature demands he will be a failure. It very frequently turns out that men who embezzle funds in their charge are of the promoter type and they would not have yielded to temptation had their efforts been confined to the work for which they are best fitted.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idau6ws1o8c">Give a man the sort of work that harmonizes with his nature and the best there is in him will exert itself.

Then came the khaki-clad dough-boys from America, and they, too, were singers. Back of their singing was an enduring faith in the cause for which they were fighting. Soon the Germans began to quit singing, and as they did so the tide of war began to turn against them.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9pv18cyf1">If church attendance had nothing else to recommend it, except the psychological effect of the song service, that would be sufficient, for no one can join in the singing of a beautiful hymn without feeling better for it.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ido3wga1265">For many years I have observed that I could write more effectively after having participated in a song service.

By actual test, in a plant employing 3,000 men and women, the production was increased forty-five per cent in less than thirty days after we had organized the workers into singing groups and installed orchestras and bands that played at ten-minute intervals such stirring songs as &#x201C;Over There,&#x201D; and &#x201C;Dixie,&#x201D; and &#x201C;There&#x2019;ll Be a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight.&#x201D; The workers caught the rhythm of the music and speeded up their work accordingly.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idkf8twoy2s">Properly selected music would stimulate any class of workers to greater <span class="itali">action,</span> a fact which does not seem to be understood by all who direct the efforts of large numbers of people.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idejh0b0wnl">In all my travels I have found but one business firm whose managers made use of music as a stimulant for their workers. This was the Filene Department Store, in Boston, Mass. During the summer months this store provides an orchestra that plays the latest dance music for half an hour before opening time, in the morning. The salespeople use the aisles of the store for dancing and by the time the doors are thrown open they are in an <span class="itali">active</span> state of mind and body that carries them through the entire day.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddpg579n09">Incidentally, I have never seen more courteous or efficient salespeople than those employed by the Filene store. One of the department managers told me that every person in his department performed more service and with less real effort, as a result of the morning music program.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idhssu0rfpi"><span class="itali">A singing army is a winning army,</span> whether on the field of battle, in warfare, or behind the counters in a department store. There is a book entitled Singing Through Life With God by George Wharton James, which I recommend to all who are interested in the psychology of song.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idti7dbbhxe">If I were the manager of an industrial plant in which the work was heavy and monotonous, I would install some sort of musical program that would supply every worker with music. On lower Broadway, in New York City, an ingenious Greek has discovered how to entertain his customers and at the same time speed up the work of his helpers by the use of a phonograph. Every boy in the place keeps time with the music as he draws the cloth across the shoes, and seems to get considerable fun out of his work in doing so.

It will be helpful to remember that these United States were born as the result of one of the most powerful Master Minds ever created. The members of this Master Mind were the signers of the Declaration of Independence.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2sktxtovy">The men who signed that document either consciously or unconsciously put into operation the power known as the &#x201C;Master Mind,&#x201D; and that power was sufficient to enable them to defeat all the soldiers who were sent into the field against them. The men who fought to make the Declaration of Independence endure did not fight for money, alone; they fought for a principle&#x2014;the principle of freedom, which is the highest known motivating force.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idkypu6dmo8">A great leader, whether in business, finance, industry or statesmanship, is one who understands how to create a motivating objective which will be accepted with enthusiasm by every member of his group of followers.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id63jrmjn5n">In politics a &#x201C;live issue&#x201D; is everything!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idapx2clykk">By &#x201C;live issue&#x201D; is meant some popular objective toward the attainment of which the majority of the voters can be rallied. These &#x201C;issues&#x201D; generally are broadcast in the form of snappy slogans, such as &#x201C;Keep Cool with Coolidge,&#x201D; which suggested to the minds of the voters that to keep Coolidge was the equivalent of keeping prosperity.

This may be profitably borne in mind by all who organize group effort for any purpose whatsoever. Find a motive around which men may be induced to rally in a highly emotionalized, enthusiastic spirit of perfect harmony and you have found the starting point for the creation of a Master Mind.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idoka1cqsek">It is a well known fact that men will work harder for the attainment of an ideal than they will for mere money. In searching for a &#x201C;motive&#x201D; as the basis for developing co-operative group effort it will be profitable to bear this fact in mind.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idbq2z4idqy">At the time of the writing of this lesson there is much adverse agitation and general criticism directed against the railroads of the country. Who is back of this agitation this author does not know, but he does know that the very fact that such agitation exists could and should be made the motivating force around which the railroad officials might rally the hundreds of thousands of railroad employees who earn their living by railroading, thereby creating a power that would effectively eliminate this adverse criticism.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id7xd31dt5w">The railroads are the very back-bone of the country. Tie up all railroad service and the people of the larger cities would starve before food could reach them. In this fact may be found a motive around which a large majority of the public could be caused to rally in support of any plan for self-protection which the railroad officials might wish to carry out.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idyuj0ljr3v">The power represented by all of the railroad employees and a majority of the public who patronize the railroads is sufficient to protect the railroads against all manner of adverse legislation and other attempts to depreciate their properties, but the power is only potential until it is organized and placed definitely back of a specific motive.</p><p class="Blank-Space-BreakBsbrk" id="id7z63gkizy">[blank]</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id51qk66952">Man is a queer animal.

Leaders who are seeking a motivating force out of which to secure action from a following may find it under one or more of these three classifications.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ido1t04g230">As you have observed, this lesson is very closely related to the Introduction and Lesson One which cover the Law of the Master Mind. It is possible for groups to function co-operatively, without thereby creating a Master Mind, as, for example, where people co-operate merely out of necessity, without the spirit of harmony as the basis of their efforts. This sort of co-operation may produce considerable power, but nothing to compare with that which is possible when every person in an alliance subordinates his or her own individual interests and co-ordinates his or her efforts with those of all other members of the alliance, in perfect harmony.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idbgnqu83yd">The extent to which people may be induced to co-operate, in harmony, depends upon the motivating force which impels them to action. Perfect harmony such as is essential for creating a Master Mind can be obtained only when the motivating force of a group is sufficient to cause each member of the group completely to forget his or her own personal interests and work for the good of the group, or for the sake of attaining some idealistic, charitable or philanthropic objective.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ids9asappia">The three major motivating forces of mankind have been here stated for the guidance of the Leader who wishes to create plans for securing co-operation from followers who will throw themselves into the carrying out of his plans in a spirit of unselfishness and perfect harmony.</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="idx7420pj4a">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="id9xyttkqzb">Your position is nothing more than your opportunity to show what sort of ability you have.

You must mix ENTHUSIASM with your action or it will be insipid and without &#x201C;kick.&#x201D; You must exercise SELF-CONTROL. You must form the habit of DOING MORE THAN PAID FOR. You must cultivate a PLEASING PERSONALITY. You must acquire the HABIT OF SAVING. You must become an ACCURATE THINKER, remembering, as you develop this quality, that accurate thought is based upon FACTS and not upon hearsay evidence or mere information. You must form the habit of CONCENTRATION by giving your undivided attention to but one task at a time. You must acquire the habit of CO-OPERATION and practice it in all your plans. You must profit by FAILURE, your own and that of others. You must cultivate the habit of TOLERANCE.

As a matter of fact, there is a great and lasting lesson in every reverse, and in every defeat; and, usually, it is a lesson that could be learned in no other way than through defeat.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id19z62i2p7">Defeat often talks to us in a &#x201C;dumb language&#x201D; that we do not understand. If this were not true, we would not make the same mistakes over and over again without profiting by the lessons that they might teach us. If it were not true, we would observe more closely the mistakes which other people make and profit by them.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idfw8v5dt19">The main object of this lesson is to help the student understand and profit by this &#x201C;dumb language&#x201D; in which defeat talks to us.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idnqitu0ak1">Perhaps I can best help you to interpret the meaning of defeat by taking you back over some of my own experiences covering a period of approximately thirty years. Within this period, I have come to the turning-point, which the uninformed call &#x201C;failure,&#x201D; seven different times. At each of these seven turning-points I thought I had made a dismal failure; but now I know that what looked to be a failure was nothing more than a kindly, unseen hand, that halted me in my chosen course and with great wisdom forced me to redirect my efforts along more advantageous pathways.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idhjryqih5y">I arrived at this decision, however, only after I had taken a retrospective view of my experiences and had analyzed them in the light of many years of sober and meditative thought.</p><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="id7ztoup8pj">First Turning-Point</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idfglpqoryz">After finishing a course in a business college, I secured a position as stenographer and bookkeeper which I held for the ensuing five years. As a result of having practiced the habit of performing more work and better work than that for which I was paid, as described in Lesson Eight of this course, I advanced rapidly until I was assuming responsibilities and receiving a salary far out of proportion to my age. I saved my money; and my bank account amounted to several thousand dollars. My reputation spread rapidly and I found competitive bidders for my services.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idy0ccail7r">To meet these offers from competitors my employer advanced me to the position of General Manager of the mines where I was employed. I was quickly getting on top of the world, and <span class="itali">I knew it!</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idk4y01ek42">Ah! but that was the sad part of my fate&#x2014;<span class="itali">I knew it!</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idbueoumn0k">Then the kindly hand of Fate reached out and gave me a gentle nudge. My employer lost his fortune and I lost my position. This was my first real defeat; and, even though it came about as a result of causes beyond my control, I should have learned a lesson from it; which, of course, I did, but not until many years later.</p><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="idqpb9stcb2">Second Turning-Point</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idhbvr87op5">My next position was that of Sales Manager for a large lumber manufacturing concern in the South. I knew nothing about lumber, and but little about sales management; but I had learned that it was beneficial to render more service than that for which I was paid; and I had also learned that it paid to take the initiative and find out what ought to be done without someone telling me to do it. A good sized bank account, plus a record of steady advancement in my previous position, gave me all the self-confidence I needed, with some to spare, perhaps.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id6323bdk4h">My advancement was rapid, my salary having been increased twice during the first year. I did so well in the management of sales that my employer took me into partnership with him. We began to make money and I began to see myself <span class="itali">on top of the world again!</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idnzrn71w07">To stand &#x201C;on top of the world&#x201D; gives one a wonderful sensation; but it is a very dangerous place to stand, unless one stands very firmly, because the fall is so long and hard if one should stumble.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idafsr9x43j">I was succeeding by leaps and bounds!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id8cn212sb7">Up to that time it had never occurred to me that <span class="itali">success</span> could be measured in terms other than money and authority. Perhaps this was due to the fact that I had more money than I needed and more authority than I could manage safely at that age.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idaz4tb36h6">Not only was I &#x201C;succeeding,&#x201D; from my viewpoint of success, but I knew I was engaged in the one and only business suited to my temperament. Nothing could have induced me to change into another line of endeavor. That is&#x2014;nothing except that which happened, which <span class="itali">forced</span> me to change.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idcuse0l3n9">The unseen hand of Fate allowed me to strut around under the influence of my own vanity until I had commenced to feel my importance. In the light of my more sober years, I now wonder if the Unseen Hand does not purposely permit us foolish human beings to parade ourselves before our own mirrors of vanity until we come to see how vulgarly we are acting and become ashamed of ourselves. At any rate, I seemed to have a clear track ahead of me; there was plenty of coal in the bunker; there was water in the tank; my hand was on the throttle&#x2014;I opened it wide and sped along at a rapid pace.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idun6wxi59f">Alas! Fate awaited me just around the corner, with a stuffed club that was not stuffed with cotton. Of course I did not see the impending crash until it came. Mine was a sad story, but not unlike that which many another might tell if he would be frank with himself.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id0z7drp0ui">Like a stroke of lightning out of a clear sky, the 1907 panic swept down upon me; and, overnight, it rendered me an enduring service by destroying my business and relieving me of every dollar that I possessed.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idg0s28tah0">This was my first serious <span class="itali">defeat!</span> I mistook it, then, for failure; but it was not, and before I complete this lesson I will tell you why it was not.</p><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="idnlkypd6j6">Third Turning-Point</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idhymf4xx0r">It required the 1907 panic, and the defeat that it brought me, to divert and redirect my efforts from the lumber business to the study of law. Nothing on earth, except defeat, could have brought about this result; thus, the third turning-point of my life was ushered in on the wings of that which most people would call &#x201C;failure,&#x201D; which reminds me to state again that every defeat teaches a needed lesson to those who are ready and willing to be taught.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id35lkecbn5">When I entered law school, it was with the firm belief that I would emerge doubly prepared to catch up with the end of the rainbow and claim my pot of gold; for I still had no other conception of success except that of <span class="itali">money</span> and power.</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="idu54s0o86w">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="idqjmc1p99z">One of the greatest leaders who ever lived stated the secret of his leadership in six words, as follows: &#x201C;Kindness is more powerful than compulsion.&#x201D;</p><p class="ENDEND" id="idw50h1a1aa">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idh5gl8v5ys">I attended law school at night and worked as an automobile salesman during the day. My sales experience in the lumber business was turned to good advantage. I prospered rapidly, doing so well (still featuring the habit of performing more service and better service than that for which I was paid) that the opportunity came to enter the automobile manufacturing business. I saw the need for trained automobile mechanics, therefore I opened an educational department in the manufacturing plant and began to train ordinary machinists in automobile assembling and repair work. The school prospered, paying me over a thousand dollars a month in net profits.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idzwqc5mbc8">Again I was beginning to near the end of the rainbow. Again I knew I had at last found my niche in the world&#x2019;s work; that nothing could swerve me from my course or divert my attention from the automobile business.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ido45gdes98">My banker knew that I was prospering, therefore he loaned me money with which to expand. A peculiar trait of bankers&#x2014;a trait which may be more or less developed in the remainder of us also&#x2014;is that they will loan us money without any hesitation when we are <span class="itali">prosperous!</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id137pzzbgc">My banker loaned me money until I was hopelessly in his debt, then he took over my business as calmly as if it had belonged to him, which it did!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idoek8kxsmf">From the station of a man of affairs who enjoyed an income of more than a thousand dollars a month, I was suddenly reduced to poverty.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id59ohrkgke">Now, twenty years later, I thank the hand of Fate for this forced change; but at that time I looked upon the change as nothing but <span class="itali">failure.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id4gx351e5l">The rainbow&#x2019;s end had disappeared, and with it the proverbial pot of gold which is supposed to be found at its end. It was many years afterwards that I learned the truth that this temporary <span class="itali">defeat</span> was probably the greatest single blessing that ever came my way, because it forced me out of a business that in no way helped me to develop knowledge of self or of others, and directed my efforts into a channel which brought me a rich experience of which I was in need.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iduqeemrx1c">For the first time in life I began to ask myself if it were not possible for one to find something of value other than money and power at the rainbow&#x2019;s end. This temporary questioning attitude did not amount to open rebellion, mind you, nor did I follow it far enough to get the answer. It merely came as a fleeting thought, as do so many other thoughts to which we pay no attention, and passed out of my mind. Had I known as much then as I now know about the Law of Compensation, and had I been able to interpret experiences as I can now interpret them, I would have recognized that event as a gentle nudge from the hand of Fate.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ido793rv2wy">After putting up the hardest fight of my life, up to that time, I accepted my temporary defeat as <span class="itali">failure</span> and thus was ushered in my next and fourth turning-point, which gave me an opportunity to put into use the knowledge of law that I had acquired.</p><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="idi861h1o1v">Fourth Turning-Point</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idt5ml2r9d8">Because I was my wife&#x2019;s husband and her people had influence I secured the appointment as assistant to the chief counsel for one of the largest coal companies in the world. My salary was greatly out of proportion to those usually paid to beginners, and still further out of proportion to what I was worth; but pull was pull, and I was there just the same. It happened that what I lacked in legal skill I more than made up through the application of the principle of performing more service than that for which I was paid, and by taking the initiative and doing that which should have been done without being told to do it.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id5c82hspfw">I was holding my position without difficulty. I practically had a soft berth for life had I cared to keep it.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id750x30bxu">Without consultation with my friends, and without warning, I resigned!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idnok5oytu2">This was the first turning-point that was of my own selection. It was not forced upon me. I saw the old man Fate coming and beat him to the door. When pressed for a reason for resigning, I gave what seemed to me to be a very sound one, but I had trouble convincing the family circle that I had acted wisely.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id0yo6c9swn">I quit that position because the work was too easy and I was performing it with too little effort. I saw myself drifting into the habit of inertia. I felt myself becoming accustomed to taking life easily and I knew that the next step would be retrogression. I had so many friends at court that there was no particular impelling urge that made it necessary for me to keep moving. I was among friends and relatives, and I had a position that I could keep as long as I wished it, without exerting myself. I received an income that provided me with all the necessities and some of the luxuries, including a motor car and enough gasoline to keep it running.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id6oy1cw1m6">What more did I need?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2ijty9x3z">&#x201C;Nothing!&#x201D; I was beginning to say to myself.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idd9owcp702">This was the attitude toward which I felt myself slipping. It was an attitude which, for some reason that is still unknown to me, startled me so sharply that I made what many believed to be an irrational move by resigning. However ignorant I might have been in other matters at the time, I have felt thankful ever since for having had sense enough to realize that strength and growth come only through continuous effort and <span class="itali">struggle,</span> that disuse brings atrophy and decay.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9wo75wnvb">This move proved to be the next most important turning-point of my life, although it was followed by ten years of effort which brought almost every conceivable grief that the human heart can experience. I quit my job in the legal field, where I was getting along well, living among friends and relatives, where I had what they believed to be an unusually bright and promising future ahead of me. I am frank to admit that it has been an ever-increasing source of wonderment to me as to why and how I gathered the courage to make the move that I did. As far as I am able to interpret the event, I arrived at my decision to resign more because of a &#x201C;hunch,&#x201D; or a sort of &#x201C;prompting&#x201D; which I then did not understand, than by logical reasoning.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idny7b213ri">I selected Chicago as my new field of endeavor. I did this because I believed Chicago to be a place where one might find out if one had those sterner qualities which are so essential for survival in a world of keen competition. I made up my mind that if I could gain recognition, in any honorable sort of work, in Chicago, it would prove that I had the sort of material in my make-up that might be developed into real ability. That was a queer process of reasoning; at least it was an unusual process for me to indulge in at that time, which reminds me to state that we human beings often take unto ourselves credit for intelligence to which we are not entitled. I fear we too often assume credit for wisdom and for results that accrue from causes over which we have absolutely no control.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id14e92w4qi">While I do not mean to convey the impression that I believe all of our acts to be controlled by causes beyond our power to direct, yet I strongly urge you to study and correctly interpret those causes which mark the most vital turning-points of your life; the points at which your efforts are diverted&#x2014;from the old into new channels&#x2014;in spite of all that you can do. <span class="itali">At least refrain from accepting any defeat as failure until you shall have had time to analyze the final result.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idxl3igmv21">My first position in Chicago was that of advertising manager of a large correspondence school. I knew but little about advertising, but my previous experience as a salesman, plus the advantage gained by rendering more service than that for which I was paid, enabled me to make an unusual showing.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id8ph8z4iy3">The first year I earned $5,200.00.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idt8ceqm1si">I was &#x201C;coming back&#x201D; by leaps and bounds. Gradually the rainbow&#x2019;s end began to circle around me, and I saw, once more, the shining pot of gold almost within my reach. History is full of evidence that a feast usually precedes a famine. I was enjoying a feast but did not anticipate the famine that was to follow. I was getting along so well that I thoroughly approved of myself.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idb907rd3iz">Self-approval is a dangerous state of mind.</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="idr49rp0kw6">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="id2f1yx9esb">Remember this, when things go against you, that of all the expressions you carry in your face the light of joy shines farthest out to sea.</p><p class="ENDEND" id="id8nn2bjpot">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idnz249h7qt">This is a great truth which many people do not learn until the softening hand of Time has rested upon their shoulders for the better part of a life-time.

We organized the Betsy Ross Candy Company and I became its first president, thus beginning the next most important turning-point of my life.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id739nkl6ms">The business grew rapidly until we had a chain of stores in eighteen different cities. Again I saw my rainbow&#x2019;s end almost within my reach. I knew that I had at last found the business in which I wished to remain for life. The candy business was profitable and, because I looked upon money as being the only evidence of success, I naturally believed I was about to corner success.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idojr189p6c">Everything went smoothly until my business associate and a third man, whom we had taken into the business, took a notion to gain control of my interest in the business without paying for it.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idpzqr1xzx9">Their plan was successful, in a way, but I balked more stiffly than they had anticipated I would; therefore, for the purpose of &#x201C;gentle persuasion,&#x201D; they had me arrested on a false charge and then offered to withdraw the charge on condition that I turn over to them my interest in the business.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idldbcx11e5">I had commenced to learn, for the first time, that there was much cruelty, and injustice, and dishonesty in the hearts of men.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idy05x1589r">When the time for a preliminary hearing came, the complaining witnesses were nowhere to be found. But I had them brought and forced them to go on the witness stand and tell their stories, which resulted in my vindication, and a damage suit against the perpetrators of the injustice.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idvjyte6d40">This incident brought about an irreparable breach between my business associates and myself, which finally cost me my interest in the business, but that was but slight when compared to that which it cost my associates; for they are still paying, and no doubt will continue to pay as long as they live.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id3mgnrs0me">My damage suit was brought under what is known as a &#x201C;tort&#x201D; action, through which damages were claimed for malicious damage to character. In Illinois, where the action was brought, judgment under a tort action gives the one in favor of whom the judgment is rendered the right to have the person against whom it is obtained placed in jail until the amount of the judgment has been paid.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idkwuzo5nyq">In due time I got a heavy judgment against my former business associates. <span class="itali">I could then have had both of them placed behind the bars.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idz39znz60n">For the first time in my life I was brought face to face with the opportunity to strike back at my enemies in a manner that would hurt. I had in my possession a weapon with &#x201C;teeth&#x201D; in it&#x2014;a weapon placed there by the enemies, themselves.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idk5y42hozb">The feeling that swept over me was a queer one!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idk82ru42uw">Would I have my enemies jailed, or would I take advantage of this opportunity to extend them mercy, thereby proving myself to be made of a different type of material.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1mqonv765">Then and there was laid, in my heart, the foundation upon which the Fifteenth Lesson of this course is built, for I made up my mind to permit my enemies to go free&#x2014;as free as they could be made by my having extended them mercy and forgiveness.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idgvfu42263">But long before my decision had been reached the hand of Fate had commenced to deal roughly with these misguided fellow men who had tried, in vain, to destroy me. Time, the master worker, to which we must all submit sooner or later, had already been at work on my former business associates, and it had dealt with them less mercifully than I had done. One of them was later sentenced to a long term in the penitentiary, for another crime that he had committed against some other person, and the other one had, meanwhile, been reduced to pauperism.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id7xr2n8qe1">We can circumvent the laws which men place upon statute books, but the Law of Compensation never!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idb2z03eeqj">The judgment which I obtained against these men stands on the records of the Superior Court, of Chicago, as silent evidence of vindication of my character; but it serves me in a more important way than that&#x2014;it serves as a reminder that I could forgive enemies who had tried to destroy me, and for this reason, instead of destroying my character, I suspect that the incident served to strengthen it.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idrs7tpjfy1">Being arrested seemed, at the time, a terrible disgrace, even though the charge was false. I did not relish the experience, and I would not wish to go through a similar experience again, but I am bound to admit that it was worth all the grief it cost me, because it gave me the opportunity to find out that revenge was not a part of my make-up.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idruqhddxx0">Here I would direct your attention to a close analysis of the events described in this lesson, for if you observe carefully you can see how this entire course of study has been evolved out of these experiences. Each temporary defeat left its mark upon my heart and provided some part of the material of which this course has been built.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddgc73gu76">We would cease to fear or to run away from trying experiences if we observed, from the biographies of men of destiny, that nearly every one of them was sorely tried and run through the mill of merciless experience before he &#x201C;arrived.&#x201D; This leads me to wonder if the hand of Fate does not test &#x201C;the metal of which we are made&#x201D; in various and sundry ways before placing great responsibilities upon our shoulders.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idf7vm30k8n">Before approaching the next turning-point of my life, may I not call your attention to the significant fact that each turning-point carried me nearer and nearer my rainbow&#x2019;s end, and brought me some useful knowledge which became, later, a permanent part of my philosophy of life.</p><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="idgic10sq1l">Sixth Turning-Point</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idmsu6vaonf">We come, now, to the turning-point which probably brought me nearer the rainbow&#x2019;s end than any of the others had, because it placed me in a position where I found it necessary to bring into use all the knowledge I had acquired up to that time, concerning practically every subject with which I was acquainted, and gave me opportunity for self-expression and development such as rarely comes to a man so early in life. This turning-point came shortly after my dreams of success in the candy business had been shattered, when I turned my efforts to teaching Advertising and Salesmanship as a department of one of the colleges of the Middle West.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idomobz81zi">Some wise philosopher has said that we never learn very much about a given subject until we commence teaching it to others. My first experience as a teacher proved this to be true. My school prospered from the very beginning. I had a resident class and also a correspondence school through which I was teaching students in nearly every English-speaking country. Despite the ravages of war, the school was growing rapidly and I again saw the end of the rainbow within sight.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idxgho2aqqa">Then came the second military draft which practically destroyed my school, as it caught most of those who were enrolled as students. At one stroke I charged off more than $75,000.00 in tuition fees and at the same time contributed my own service to my country.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idbv1vem9s0">Once more I was penniless!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idrs5x56xsa">Unfortunate is the person who has never had the thrill of being penniless at one time or another; for, as Edward Bok has truthfully stated, poverty is the richest experience that can come to a man; an experience which, however, he advises one to get away from as quickly as possible.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idoc2v1554d">Again I was forced to redirect my efforts, but, before I proceed to describe the next and last important turning-point, I wish to call your attention to the fact that no single event described up to this point is, within itself, of any practical significance. The six turning-points that I have briefly described meant nothing to me, taken singly, and they will mean nothing to you if analyzed singly. But take these events collectively and they form a very significant foundation for the next turning-point, and constitute reliable evidence that we human beings are constantly undergoing evolutionary changes as a result of the experiences of life with which we meet, even though no single experience may seem to convey a definite, usable lesson.</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="idtg3uydugk">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="idnotdh639z">It is far better to be associated with a few who are right than with the mob which is wrong, because right is always the winner in the end.</p><p class="ENDEND" id="idu1fsyvluy">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id8i6tdjwt9">I feel impelled to dwell at length on the point which I am here trying to make clear, because I have now reached the point in my career at which men go down in permanent defeat or rise, with renewed energies, to heights of attainment of stupendous proportions, according to the manner in which they interpret their past experiences and use those experiences as the basis of working plans. If my story stopped here it would be of no value to you, but there is another and a more significant chapter yet to be written, covering the seventh and most important of all the turning-points of my life.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id3eokw397a">It must have been obvious to you, all through my description of the six turning-points already outlined, that I had not really found my place in the world. It must have been obvious to you that most, if not all, of my temporary defeats were due mainly to the fact that I had not yet discovered the work into which I could throw my heart and soul. Finding the work for which one is best fitted and which one likes best is very much like finding the one person whom one loves best; there is no rule by which to make the search, but when the right niche is contacted one immediately recognizes it.</p><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="id8l5qsau38">Seventh Turning-Point</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idbae301bwj">Before I finish I will describe the collective lessons that I learned from each of the seven turning-points of my life, but first let me describe the seventh and last of these turning-points. To do so, I must go back to that eventful day&#x2014;<span class="itali">November Eleven, Nineteen Hundred and Eighteen!</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id66riswoel">That was armistice day, as everyone knows. The war had left me without a penny, as I have already stated, but I was happy to know that the slaughter had ceased and reason was about to reclaim civilization once more.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idlkqp1ebax">As I stood in front of my office window and looked out at the howling mob that was celebrating the end of the war, my mind went back into my yesterdays, especially to that eventful day when that kind old gentleman laid his hand on my shoulder and told me that if I would acquire an education I could make my mark in the world. I had been acquiring that education without knowing it. Over a period of more than twenty years I had been going to school in the University of Hard Knocks, as you must have observed from my description of the various turning-points of my life. As I stood in front of that window my entire past, with its bitter and its sweet, its ups and its downs, passed before me in review.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id8hi372m75"><span class="itali">The time had come for another turning-point!</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idl6v3hp8yl">I sat down to my typewriter and, to my astonishment, my hands began to play a regular tune upon the key-board. I had never written so rapidly or so easily before. I did not plan or think about that which I was writing&#x2014;<span class="itali">I just wrote that which came into my mind!</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddf1krupk7">Unconsciously, I was laying the foundation for the most important turning-point of my life; for, when I had finished, I had prepared a document through which I financed a national magazine that gave me contact with people throughout the English-speaking world. So greatly did that document influence my own career, and the lives of tens of thousands of other people, that I believe it will be of interest to the students of this course; therefore, I am reproducing it, just as it appeared in <span class="itali">Hill&#x2019;s Golden Rule</span> magazine, where it was first published, as follows:</p><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="idwunwo357q">&#x201C;A Personal Visit with Your Editor&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idg8ic11fr2">I am writing on Monday, November eleventh, 1918. Today will go down in history as the greatest holiday.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2epvfhwnl">On the street, just outside of my office window, the surging crowds of people are celebrating the downfall of an influence that has menaced civilization for the past four years.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idb2jwpngcs">The war is over!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ido0tmtjy2o">Soon our boys will be coming back home from the battlefields of France.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idhm37xyegv">The lord and master of Brute Force is nothing but a shadowy ghost of the past!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idjty08wu0w">Two thousand years ago the Son of man was an outcast, with no place of abode. Now the situation has been reversed and the devil has no place to lay his head.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id67ph6d16f">Let each of us take unto himself the great lesson that this world war has taught; namely, only that which is based upon justice and mercy toward all&#x2014;the weak and the strong, the rich and the poor, alike&#x2014;can survive. All else must pass on.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id6iop5u17n">Out of this war will come a new idealism&#x2014;an idealism that will be based upon the Golden Rule philosophy; an idealism that will guide us, not to see how much we can &#x201C;do our fellow man for&#x201D;; but how much we can do for him that will ameliorate his hardships and make him happier as he tarries by the wayside of life.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idf3nwhav1c">Emerson embodied this idealism in his great essay, the Law of Compensation. Another great Philosopher embodied it in these words, &#x201C;Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id60m20mdv9">The time for practicing the Golden Rule philosophy is upon us. In business as well as in social relationships he who neglects or refuses to use this philosophy as the basis of his dealings will but hasten the time of his failure.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idq6khdrp64">And, while I am intoxicated with the glorious news of the war&#x2019;s ending, is it not fitting that I should attempt to do something to help preserve for the generations yet to come, one of the great lessons to be learned from William Hohenzollern&#x2019;s effort to rule the earth by <span class="itali">force?</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1umooxrrz">I can best do this by going back twenty-two years for my beginning. Come with me, won&#x2019;t you?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idvmzhzzd7j">It was a bleak November morning, probably not far from the eleventh of the month, that I got my first job as a laborer in the coal mine regions of Virginia, at wages of a dollar a day.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id05c6kgn94">A dollar a day was a big sum in those days; especially to a boy of my age. Of this, I paid fifty cents a day for my board and room.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idhlxlyrkgt">Shortly after I began work, the miners became dissatisfied and commenced talking about striking. I listened eagerly to all that was said. I was especially interested in the organizer who had organized the union. He was one of the smoothest speakers I had ever heard, and his words fascinated me. He said one thing, in particular, that I have never forgotten; and, if I knew where to find him, I would look him up today and thank him warmly for saying it. The philosophy which I gathered from his words has had a most profound and enduring influence upon me.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idjzbj8gtlf">Perhaps you will say that most labor agitators are not very sound philosophers; and I would agree with you if you said so. Maybe this one was not a sound philosopher, but surely the philosophy he expounded on this occasion was sound.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddhuzb2m8h">Standing on a dry goods box, in the corner of an old shop where he was holding a meeting, he said:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idvjup3jvq9">&#x201C;Men, we are talking about striking. Before you vote I wish to call your attention to something that will benefit you if you will heed what I say.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id3nl7vhvwy">&#x201C;You want more money for your work; and I wish to see you get it, because I believe you deserve it.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idcrtr5uula">&#x201C;May I not tell you how to get more money and still retain the good-will of the owner of this mine?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idfojxffijn">&#x201C;We can call a strike and probably force them to pay more money, but we cannot force them to do this and like it. Before we call a strike, let us be fair with the owner of the mine and with ourselves; let us go to the owner and ask him if he will divide the profits of his mine with us fairly.</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="idy6wn83l95">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="ids7ktjo9pd">No one is living aright unless he so lives that whoever meets him goes away more confident and joyous for the contact.</p><p class="Epigraph-SourceEpisrc" id="idwo4udju5y">&#x2014;Lilian Whiting</p><p class="ENDEND" id="idjq2yb9giy">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idq8rrk3dgu">&#x201C;If he says &#x2018;yes,&#x2019; as he probably will, then let us ask him how much he made last month and, if he will divide among us a fair proportion of any additional profits he may make if we all jump in and help him earn more next month.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idsrni0o82k">&#x201C;He, being human, like each of us, will no doubt say&#x2014;&#x2018;Why, certainly boys; go to it and I&#x2019;ll divide with you.&#x2019; It is but natural that he would say that, boys.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idgf64irzpk">&#x201C;After he agrees to the plan, as I believe he will if we make him see that we are in earnest, I want every one of you to come to work with a smile on your face for the next thirty days. I want to hear you whistling a tune as you go into the mines. I want you to go at your work with the feeling that you are one of the partners in this business.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idn0rr8hzmr">&#x201C;Without hurting yourself you can do almost twice as much work as you are doing; and if you do more work, you are sure to help the owner of this mine make more money. And if he makes more money he will be glad to divide a part of it with you. He will do this for sound business reasons if not out of a spirit of fair play.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id5y43rvcbd">&#x201C;He will retaliate as surely as there is a God above us. If he doesn&#x2019;t, I&#x2019;ll be personally responsible to you, and if you say so I&#x2019;ll help blow this mine into smithereens!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idbvxjs29tr">&#x201C;That&#x2019;s how much I think of the plan, boys!

Every month thereafter each man received a bright red envelope with his part of the extra earnings in it.

It is a considerable jump from the position of common laborer in the coal mines to that of Assistant to the Chief Counsel of one of the largest companies&#x2014;a jump that I never could have made without the aid of this principle of performing more work than I was paid to perform.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idk2elsfm0h">I wish I had the space in which to tell you of the scores of times that this idea of performing more work than I was paid to perform has helped me over rough spots.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idbq6vgfu75">Many have been the times that I have placed an employer so deeply in my debt, through the aid of this principle, that I got whatever I asked for, without hesitation or quibbling; without complaint or hard feelings; and, what is more important, without the feeling that I was taking unfair advantage of my employer.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idpp16etg29">I believe most earnestly that anything a man acquires from his fellow man without the full consent of the one from whom it is acquired, will eventually burn a hole in his pocket, or blister the palms of his hands, to say nothing of gnawing at his conscience until his heart aches with regret.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id8vrc12b2r">As I said in the beginning, I am writing on the morning of the eleventh of November, while the crowds are celebrating the great victory of <span class="itali">right</span> over <span class="itali">wrong!</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idht6d8ehss">Therefore, it is but natural that I should turn to the silence of my heart for some thought to pass on to the world today&#x2014;some thought that will help keep alive in the minds of Americans the spirit of idealism for which they have fought and in which they entered the world war.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id7gos5i0hw">I find nothing more appropriate than the philosophy which I have related, because I earnestly believe it was the arrogant disregard of this philosophy that brought Germany&#x2014;the Kaiser and his people&#x2014;to grief.

The philosophy which will raise you, my dear reader, whoever you may be and whatever you may be doing, into whatever position in life you may make up your mind to attain.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id71930lxll">Every person has, or ought to have, the inherent desire to own something of monetary value.

Contact with these people went a very long way toward giving me the courage to keep on doing the good work that I had started.

The water was pouring down over the plate-glass window in two great streams, and playing backward and forward from one of these streams to the other were little streams, making what resembled a great ladder of water.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idhj2e8ot9q">As I looked at this unusual scene, the thought &#x201C;flashed into my mind&#x201D; that I would have a splendid lecture if I organized all that I had learned from the seven turning-points of my life and all I had learned from studying the lives of successful men, and offered it under the title of the &#x201C;Magic Ladder to Success.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idjy0v9614q">On the back of an envelope I outlined the fifteen points out of which this lecture was built, and later I worked these points into a lecture that was literally built from the temporary defeats described in the seven turning-points of my life.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idkf285xkmz">All that I lay claim to knowing that is of value is represented by these fifteen points; and the material out of which this knowledge was gathered is nothing more or less than the knowledge that was <span class="itali">forced</span> upon me through experiences which have undoubtedly been classed, by some, as <span class="itali">failures!</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idh3ywip63a">The reading course, of which this lesson is a part, is but the sum total of that which I gathered through these &#x201C;failures.&#x201D; If this course proves to be of value to you, as I hope it will, you may give the credit to those &#x201C;failures&#x201D; described in this lesson.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idqgufys29d">Perhaps you will wish to know what material, monetary benefits I have gained from these turning-points, for you probably realize that we are living in an age in which life is an irksome struggle for existence and none too pleasant for those who are cursed with poverty.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idkuh4k35ip">All right! I&#x2019;ll be frank with you.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idmqgr0murm">To begin with, the estimated income from the sale of this course is all that I need, and this, despite the fact that I have insisted that my publishers apply the Ford philosophy and sell the course at a popular price that is within the reach of all who want it.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idn2b2kd7ua">In addition to the income from the sale of the course (which, please bear in mind, is but the sale of knowledge I have gathered through &#x201C;failure&#x201D;), I am now engaged in writing a series of illustrated editorials that is to be syndicated and published in the newspapers of the country. These editorials are based upon these same fifteen points as outlined in this course.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idzd7tw9pxm">The estimated net income from the sale of the editorials is more than enough to care for my needs.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idopzafzf3o">In addition to this I am now engaged in collaboration with a group of scientists, psychologists and business men, in writing a postgraduate course which will soon be available to all students who have mastered this more elementary course, covering not only the fifteen laws here outlined, from a more advanced viewpoint, but including still other laws which have but recently been discovered.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idk16ren93f">I have mentioned these facts only because I know what a common thing it is for all of us to measure success in terms of dollars, and to refuse, as unsound, all philosophy that does not foot up a good bank balance.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idniq9gh74s">Practically all the past years of my life I have been poor&#x2014;exceedingly poor&#x2014;as far as bank balances were concerned. This condition has been, very largely, a matter of choice with me, because I have been putting the best of my time into the toilsome job of throwing off some of my ignorance and gathering in some of the knowledge of life of which I felt myself in need.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idit0nckgp6">From the experiences described in these seven turning-points of my life, I have gathered a few golden threads of knowledge that I could have gained in no other way than through <span class="itali">defeat!</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idjwc7cr6bw">My own experiences have led me to believe that the &#x201C;dumb language&#x201D; of <span class="itali">defeat</span> is the plainest and most effective language in the world, once one begins to understand it. I am almost tempted to say that I believe it to be the universal language in which Nature cries out to us when we will listen to no other language.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idrmmai6owm">I am glad that I have experienced much defeat!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idcf7s6jdaj">It has had the effect of tempering me with the courage to undertake tasks that I would never have begun had I been surrounded by protecting influences.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iddo0i1ojhh">Defeat is a destructive force only when it is accepted as failure!

It is the chief cause of all wars. It makes enemies in business and in the professions. It disintegrates the organized forces of society in a thousand forms, and stands, like a mighty giant, as a barrier to the abolition of war. It dethrones reason and substitutes mob psychology in its place.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id4j6vcqwqy"><span class="itali">Second: Intolerance</span> is the chief disintegrating force in the organized religions of the world, where it plays havoc with the greatest power for good there is on this earth; by breaking up that power into small sects and denominations which spend as much effort opposing each other as they do in destroying the evils of the world.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idq3cbgw1wf">But this indictment against <span class="itali">intolerance</span> is general. Let&#x2019;s see how it affects you, the individual. It is, of course, obvious that anything which impedes the progress of civilization stands, also, as a barrier to each individual; and, stating it conversely, anything that beclouds the mind of the individual and retards his mental, moral and spiritual development, retards, also, the progress of civilization.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id3b3lzucwp">All of which is an abstract statement of a great truth; and, inasmuch as abstract statements are neither interesting nor highly informative, let us proceed to illustrate more concretely the damaging effects of <span class="itali">intolerance.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idyyuem2tkz">I will begin this illustration by describing an incident which I have mentioned quite freely in practically every public address that I have delivered within the past five years; but, inasmuch as the cold printed page has a modifying effect which makes possible the misinterpretation of the incident here described, I believe it necessary to caution you not to read back of the lines a meaning which I had no intention of placing there. You will do yourself an injustice if you either neglect or intentionally refuse to study this illustration in the exact words and with the exact meaning which I have intended those words to convey&#x2014;a meaning as clear as I know how to make the English language convey it.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idufxv5zi1w">As you read of this incident, place yourself in my position and see if you, also, have not had a parallel experience, and, if so, what lesson did it teach you?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idzypa4lkua">One day I was introduced to a young man of unusually fine appearance. His clear eye, his warm hand-clasp, the tone of his voice and the splendid taste with which he was groomed marked him as a young man of the highest intellectual type. He was of the typical young American college student type, and as I ran my eyes over him, hurriedly studying his personality, as one will naturally do under such circumstances, I observed a Knights of Columbus pin on his vest.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2ecefe6qg">Instantly, I released his hand as if it were a piece of ice!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id3kv4c2k1a">This was done so quickly that it surprised both him and me. As I excused myself and started to walk away, I glanced down at the Masonic pin that I wore on my own vest, then took another look at his Knights of Columbus pin, and wondered why a couple of trinkets such as these could dig such a deep chasm between men who knew nothing of each other.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idhoich5lb8">All the remainder of that day I kept thinking of the incident, because it bothered me. I had always taken considerable pride in the thought that I was tolerant with all men; but here was a spontaneous outburst of <span class="itali">intolerance</span> which proved that down in my sub-conscious mind existed a complex that was influencing me toward narrow-mindedness.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ids8w4xvltm">This discovery so shocked me that I began a systematic process of psycho-analysis through which I searched into the very depths of my soul for the cause of my rudeness.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idvywp76l6m">I asked myself over and over again:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idza6vnscnh"><span class="itali">&#x201C;Why did you abruptly release that young man&#x2019;s hand and turn away from him, when you knew nothing about him?&#x201D;</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idkl9g87qlu">Of course the answer led me, always, back to that Knights of Columbus pin that he wore. But that was not a real answer and therefore it did not satisfy me.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idiftrxcwfx">Then I began to do some research work in the field of religion. I began to study both Catholicism and Protestantism until I had traced both back to their beginning, a line of procedure which I must confess brought me more understanding of the problems of life than I had gathered from all other sources. For one thing it disclosed the fact that Catholicism and Protestantism differ more in <span class="itali">form</span> than they do in <span class="itali">effect;</span> that both are founded on exactly the same <span class="itali">cause,</span> which is Christianity.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idz1vubntge">But this was by no means all, nor was it the most important of my discoveries, for my research led, of necessity, in many directions, and forced me into the field of biology where I learned much that I needed to know about life in general and the human being in particular. My research led, also, to the study of Darwin&#x2019;s hypothesis of evolution, as outlined in his Origin of Species, and this, in turn, led to a much wider analysis of the subject of psychology than that which I had previously made.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idtz1olo17e">As I began to reach out in this direction and that, for knowledge, my mind began to unfold and broaden with such alarming rapidity that I practically found it necessary to&#x2014;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idvmny86rry"><span class="itali">Wipe the slate of what I believed to be my previously gathered knowledge, and to unlearn much that I had previously believed to be truth.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idttsqzkfwi">Comprehend the meaning of that which I have just stated!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idfm6w2b2qc">Imagine yourself suddenly discovering that most of your philosophy of life had been built of bias and prejudice, making it necessary for you to acknowledge that, far from being a finished scholar, <span class="itali">you were barely qualified to become an intelligent student!</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idvkjq2j730">That was exactly the position in which I found myself, with respect to many of what I believed to be sound fundamentals of life; but of all the discoveries to which this research led, none was more important than that of the relative importance of <span class="itali">physical</span> and <span class="itali">social </span>heredity, for it was this discovery that disclosed the <span class="itali">cause</span> for my action when I turned away from a man whom I did not know, on the occasion that I have described.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2t4abvjyd">It was this discovery that disclosed to me <span class="itali">how</span> and <span class="itali">where</span> I acquired my views of religion, of politics, of economics and many other equally important subjects, and I both regret and rejoice to state that <span class="itali">I found most of my views on these subjects without support by even a reasonable hypothesis,</span> much less sound <span class="itali">facts</span> or reason.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idhlux8j19s">I then recalled a conversation between the late Senator Robert L. Taylor and myself, in which we were discussing the subject of politics. It was a friendly discussion, as we were of the same political faith, but the Senator asked me a question for which I never forgave him until I began the research to which I have referred.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idj5qylodyo">&#x201C;I see that you are a very staunch Democrat,&#x201D; said he, &#x201C;and I wonder if you know <span class="itali">why </span>you are?&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idioeirimc6">I thought of the question for a few seconds, then blurted out this reply:</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="id9a0j6gm1r">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-VerseEpiv" id="iduk327dokn">Hearts, like doors, can ope with ease,</p><p class="Epigraph-VerseEpiv" id="idv5rq6c5hz">To very, very little keys;</p><p class="Epigraph-VerseEpiv" id="id2vuquja4t">And don&#x2019;t forget that they are these:</p><p class="Epigraph-VerseEpiv" id="idmrq90przw">&#x201C;I thank you, sir,&#x201D; and &#x201C;If you please.&#x201D;</p><p class="ENDEND" id="idqtti4mmf0">END</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idu15dawjo0">&#x201C;I am a Democrat because my father was one, of course!&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idjjwxx995f">With a broad grin on his face the Senator then nailed me with this rejoinder:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idv8kflglfq">&#x201C;Just as I thought! Now wouldn&#x2019;t you be in a bad fix if your father had been a horse-thief?&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2ywv8cx71">It was many years later, after I began the research work herein described, that I understood the real meaning of Senator Taylor&#x2019;s joke. Too often we hold opinions that are based upon no sounder foundation than that of what someone else believes.</p><p class="Blank-Space-BreakBsbrk" id="idkov8k0dew">[blank]</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idcjozpkcwz">That you may have a detailed illustration of the far-reaching effects of one of the important principles uncovered by the incident to which I have referred, and&#x2014;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idy8t70i7fi"><span class="itali">That you may learn how and where you acquired your philosophy of life, in general;</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idpmrb0yqrg"><span class="itali">That you may trace your prejudices and your biases to their original source;</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idddw4hw92e"><span class="itali">That you may discover, as I discovered, how largely you are the result of the training you received before you reached the age of fifteen years&#x2014;</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idnb42fa69l">I will now quote the full text of a plan which I submitted to Mr. Edward Bok&#x2019;s Committee, The American Peace Award, for the abolition of war. This plan covers not only the most important of the principles to which I refer, but, as you will observe, it shows how the principle of <span class="itali">organized effort,</span> as outlined in Lesson One of this course, may be applied to one of the most important of the world&#x2019;s problems, and at the same time gives you a more comprehensive idea of how to apply this principle in the <span class="itali">attainment</span> of your <span class="itali">definite chief aim.</span></p><p class="A-HeadAhead" id="idu715fc2f5">How to Abolish War</p><p class="B-HeadBhead" id="id8auh8lxoi">The Background</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idu8obn2rzb">Before offering this plan for the prevention of war, it seems necessary to sketch briefly a background that will clearly describe the principle which constitutes the warp and the woof of the plan.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idqhjyigu5f">The causes of war may be properly omitted for the reason that they have but little, if any, relation to the principle through which war may be prevented.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idueu9dc6l2">The beginning of this sketch deals with two important factors which constitute the chief controlling forces of civilization. One is <span class="itali">physical heredity</span> and the other is <span class="itali">social heredity.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idoochtd6p0">The size and form of the body, the texture of the skin, the color of the eyes, and the functioning power of the vital organs are all the result of physical heredity; they are static and fixed and cannot be changed, for they are the result of a million years of evolution; but by far the most important part of what we are is the result of social heredity, and came to us from the effects of our environment and early training.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idla69vzdr4">Our conception of religion, politics, economics, philosophy and other subjects of a similar nature, including war, is entirely the result of those dominating forces of our environment and training.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id3w4flxkyu">The Catholic is a Catholic because of his early training, and the Protestant is a Protestant for the same reason; but this is hardly stating the truth with sufficient emphasis, for it might be properly said that the Catholic is a Catholic and the Protestant is a Protestant <span class="itali">because he cannot help it!</span> With but few exceptions the religion of the adult is the result of his religious training during the years between four and fourteen when his religion was <span class="itali">forced</span> upon him by his parents or those who had control of his schooling.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id7n1wc8aai">A prominent clergyman indicated how well he understood the principle of social heredity when he said: &#x201C;Give me the control of the child until it is twelve years old and you can teach it any religion you may please after that time, for I will have planted my own religion so deeply in its mind that no power on earth could undo my work.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idivmw43y67">The outstanding and most prominent of man&#x2019;s beliefs are those which were forced upon him, or which he absorbed of his own volition, under <span class="itali">highly emotionalized</span> conditions, when his mind was receptive. Under such conditions the evangelist can plant the idea of religion more deeply and permanently during an hour&#x2019;s revival service than he could through years of training under ordinary conditions, when the mind was not in an emotionalized state.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idzp2dhnd3p">The people of the United States have immortalized Washington and Lincoln because they were the leaders of the nation during times when the minds of the people were highly emotionalized, as the result of calamities which shook the very foundation of our country and vitally affected the interests of all the people. Through the principle of social heredity, operating through the schools (American history), and through other forms of impressive teaching, the immortality of Washington and Lincoln is planted in the minds of the young and in that way kept alive.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idf9a5c8xxa">The three great <span class="itali">organized forces</span> through which social heredity operates are:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idykfyjovx8">The <span class="itali">schools,</span> the <span class="itali">churches</span> and the <span class="itali">public press.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id7ykbwv6r7">Any ideal that has the active co-operation of these three forces may, <span class="itali">during the brief period of one generation, be forced upon the minds of the young so effectively that they cannot resist it.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idfjuo6iqnz">In 1914 the world awoke one morning to find itself aflame with warfare on a scale previously unheard of, and the outstanding feature of importance of that world-wide calamity was the highly organized German armies. For more than three years these armies gained ground so rapidly that world domination by Germany seemed certain. The German military machine operated with efficiency such as had never before been demonstrated in warfare. With &#x201C;kultur&#x201D; as her avowed ideal, modern Germany swept the opposing armies before her as though they were leaderless, despite the fact that the allied forces outnumbered her own on every front.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idsw6icrhqv">The capacity for sacrifice in the German soldiers, in support of the ideal of &#x201C;kultur,&#x201D; was the outstanding surprise of the war; and that capacity was largely the result of the work of two men. Through the German educational system, which they controlled, the psychology which carried the world into war in 1914 was created in the definite form of &#x201C;kultur.&#x201D; These men were Adalbert Falk, Prussian Minister of Education until 1879, and the German Emperor William II.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idp0l8urvt5">The agency through which these men produced this result was <span class="itali">social heredity:</span> the imposing of an ideal on the minds of the young, under highly emotionalized conditions.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="iday3oqh3w7">&#x201C;Kultur,&#x201D; as a national ideal, was fixed in the minds of the young of Germany, beginning first in the elementary schools and extending on up through the high schools and universities. <span class="itali">The teachers and professors were forced to implant the ideal of &#x201C;kultur&#x201D; in the minds of the students,</span> and out of this teaching, in a single generation, grew the capacity for sacrifice of the individual for the interest of the nation which surprised the modern world.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id6szk7rn7w">As Benjamin Kidd so well stated the case: &#x201C;The aim of the state of Germany was everywhere to orientate public opinion through the heads of both its spiritual and temporal departments, through the bureaucracy, through the officers of the army, through the State direction of the press; and, last of all, through the State direction of the entire trade and industry of the nation, so as to bring the idealism of the whole people to a conception of and to a support of the national policy of modern Germany.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idc0dkwormp">Germany controlled the press, the clergy and the schools; therefore, is it any wonder that she grew an army of soldiers, during one generation, which represented to a man her ideal of &#x201C;kultur&#x201D;? Is it any wonder that the German soldiers faced certain death with fearless impunity, when one stops to consider the fact that they had been taught, from early childhood, that this sacrifice was a rare privilege?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idlp0hyrl1w">Turn, now, from this brief description of the modus operandi through which Germany prepared her people for war, to another strange phenomenon, Japan.

If I were a department store owner, and used whole pages of newspaper space, as most of them do, I would run a comic strip at the bottom of each page, illustrating it with scenes in my play-room, and in this way induce the children to read my advertisements.</p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="idm7e3b44tc">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="idpnun8f9h7">Singleness of purpose is one of the chief essentials for success in life, no matter what may be one&#x2019;s aim.</p><p class="Epigraph-SourceEpisrc" id="idhps4hpp7s">&#x2014;John D.

For this very reason, I have endeavored to outline the application of these principles to as wide a scope of subjects as possible.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idhkr76j3sw">In this lesson, you have had opportunity to observe the application of the principles underlying the subjects of <span class="itali">organized effort, tolerance</span> and <span class="itali">social heredity</span> to an extent which must have given you much food for thought, and which must have given your <span class="itali">imagination</span> much room for profitable exercise.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idl91ehomjf">I have endeavored to show you how these principles may be employed both in the furtherance of your own individual interests, in whatever calling you may be engaged, and for the benefit of civilization as a whole.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id46bm4p6zw">Whether your calling is that of preaching sermons, selling goods or personal services, practicing law, directing the efforts of others, or working as a day laborer, it seems not too much to hope that you will find in this lesson a stimulus to thought which may lead you to higher achievements. If, perchance, you are a writer of advertisements you will surely find in this lesson sufficient food for thought to add more power to your pen. If you have personal services for sale, it is not unreasonable to expect that this lesson will suggest ways and means of marketing those services to greater advantage.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1tlzsnenj">In uncovering for you the source from which <span class="itali">intolerance</span> is usually developed, this lesson has led you, also, to the study of other thought-provoking subjects which might easily mark the most profitable turning-point of your life. Books and lessons, in themselves, are of but little value; their real value, if any, lies not in their printed pages, but <span class="itali">in the possible action which they may arouse in the reader.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idq6pnll8mk">For example, when my proof-reader had finished reading the manuscript of this lesson, she informed me that it had so impressed her and her husband that they intended to go into the advertising business and supply banks with an advertising service that would reach the parents through the children. She believes the plan is worth $10,000.00 a year to her.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idqh10uorw2">Frankly, her plan so appealed to me that I would estimate its value at a minimum of more than three times the amount she mentioned, and I doubt not that it could be made to yield five times that amount, if it were properly organized and marketed by an able salesman.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idjjz73u7bf">Nor is that all that this lesson has accomplished before passing from the manuscript stage. A prominent business college owner, to whom I showed the manuscript, has already begun to put into effect the suggestion which referred to the use of <span class="itali">social heredity</span> as a means of &#x201C;cultivating&#x201D; students; and he is sanguine enough to believe that a plan, similar to the one he intends using, could be sold to the majority of the 1500 business colleges in the United States and Canada, on a basis that would yield the promoter of the plan a yearly income greater than the salary received by the President of the United States.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id0num6uug5">And, as this lesson is being completed, I am in receipt of a letter from Dr. Charles F.

I lay no claim to it except that of having observed its unvarying application in the every-day walks of life over a period of more than twenty-five years of struggle; and, of having appropriated as much of it as, in the light of my human frailties and weaknesses, I could make use of.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idognkzcfbt">If you demand <span class="itali">positive</span> proof of the soundness of the laws upon which this course in general, and this lesson in particular, is founded, I must plead inability to offer it except through one witness, and that is <span class="itali">yourself.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idkdz5dmcv4">You may have <span class="itali">positive</span> proof only by testing and applying these laws for yourself.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idwrjsko8cj">If you demand more substantial and authoritative evidence than my own, then I am privileged to refer you to the teachings and philosophy of Christ, Plato, Socrates, Epictetus, Confucius, Emerson and two of the more modern philosophers, James and M&#xFC;nsterberg, from whose works I have appropriated all that constitutes the more important fundamentals of this lesson, with the exception of that which I have gathered from my own limited experience.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idpf7lfuoi5">For more than four thousand years men have been preaching the Golden Rule as a suitable rule of conduct among men, but unfortunately the world has accepted the letter while totally missing the spirit of this Universal Injunction. We have accepted the Golden Rule philosophy merely as a sound rule of ethical conduct but we have failed to understand the law upon which it is based.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id1myxn4rxg">I have heard the Golden Rule quoted scores of times, but I do not recall having ever heard an explanation of the law upon which it is based, and not until recent years did I understand that law, from which I am led to believe that those who quoted it did not understand it.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idn58fh2f7i">The Golden Rule means, substantially, to do unto others as you would wish them to do unto you if your positions were reversed.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id0qndewbl9">But why? What is the <span class="itali">real</span> reason for this kindly consideration of others?</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idsrcr4a81s">The real reason is this:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id7bylq6niu">There is an eternal law through the operation of which we reap that which we sow. When you select the rule of conduct by which you guide yourself in your transactions with others, you will be fair and just, very likely, if you know that you are setting into motion, by that selection, a <span class="itali">power</span> that will run its course for weal or woe in the lives of others, returning, finally, to help or to hinder you, according to its nature.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id0chzxxrjh">&#x201C;Whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap&#x201D;!</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idgt0gzsj3w">It is your privilege to deal unjustly with others, but, if you understand the law upon which the Golden Rule is based, you must know that your unjust dealings will &#x201C;come home to roost.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idhusjz7zld">If you fully understood the principles described in Lesson Ten, on <span class="itali">accurate thought,</span> it will be quite easy for you to understand the law upon which the Golden Rule is based.

Despite the simplicity of the law it is practically all there is to be learned that is of enduring value to man, for it is the medium through which we become the masters of our own destiny.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9hhs34kjg">Understand this law and you understand <span class="itali">all</span> that the Bible has to unfold to you, for the Bible presents one unbroken chain of evidence in support of the fact that man is the maker of his own destiny; and, that his <span class="itali">thoughts</span> and <span class="itali">acts</span> are the tools with which he does the <span class="itali">making.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idt0q14q64i">During ages of less enlightenment and tolerance than that of the present, some of the greatest thinkers the world has ever produced have paid with their lives for daring to uncover this Universal Law so that it might be understood by all. In the light of the past history of the world, it is an encouraging bit of evidence, in support of the fact that men are gradually throwing off the veil of ignorance and intolerance, to note that I stand in no danger of bodily harm for writing that which would have cost me my life a few centuries ago.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idiu75cfpe8">While this course deals with the highest laws of the universe, which man is capable of interpreting, the aim, nevertheless, has been to show how these laws may be used in the practical affairs of life.

You see, I found the little house easily enough and knocked on the outer door, which stood ajar; but nobody heard me, so I stepped into the little hall and saw through the crack of a door a cozy sitting-room, and there on the bed, with her silver head high on the pillows, was an old lady who looked for all the world just like my mother did the last time I ever saw her on earth. Well, I was on the point of knocking, when she said: &#x2018;Come, father, now begin; I&#x2019;m all ready.&#x2019; And down on his knees by her side went an old, white-haired man, still older than his wife, I should judge, and I couldn&#x2019;t have knocked then, for the life of me. Well, he began. First, he reminded God they were still His submissive children, mother and he, and no matter what He saw fit to bring upon them they shouldn&#x2019;t rebel at His will. Of course &#x2019;twas going to be very hard for them to go out homeless in their old age, especially with poor mother so sick and helpless, and, oh! how different it all might have been if only one of the boys had been spared. Then his voice kind of broke, and a white hand stole from under the coverlid and moved softly over his snowy hair. Then he went on to repeat that nothing could be so sharp again as the parting with those three sons&#x2014;unless mother and he should be separated.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id64r43fr1x">&#x201C;But, at last, he fell to comforting himself with the fact that the dear Lord knew that it was through no fault of his own that mother and he were threatened with the loss of their dear little home, which meant beggary and the alms-house&#x2014;a place they prayed to be delivered from entering if it should be consistent with God&#x2019;s will. And then he quoted a multitude of promises concerning the safety of those who put their trust in the Lord. In fact, it was the most thrilling plea to which I ever listened. And at last, he prayed for God&#x2019;s blessing on those who were about to demand justice.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idrprsf2mca">The lawyer then continued, more lowly than ever: &#x201C;And I&#x2014;believe&#x2014;I&#x2019;d rather go to the poor-house myself tonight than to stain my heart and hands with the blood of such a prosecution as that.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idtlqlvzt9y">&#x201C;Little afraid to defeat the old man&#x2019;s prayer, eh?&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idni6cspd77">&#x201C;Bless your soul, man, you couldn&#x2019;t defeat it!&#x201D; said the lawyer. &#x201C;I tell you he left it all subject to the will of God; but he claimed that we were told to make known our desires unto God; but of all the pleadings I ever heard that beat all.

It was the regular morning company of drunks and disorderlies. Some were old and hardened; others hung their heads in shame. Just as the momentary disorder attending the bringing in of the prisoners quieted down, a strange thing happened. A strong, clear voice from below began singing:</p><p class="Verse1Vrs1" id="ida5bg0it0i">&#x201C;Last night I lay a-sleeping,</p><p class="Verse1Vrs1" id="idqs2a4z77e">There came a dream so fair.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id42dexo26m">&#x201C;Last night!&#x201D; It had been for them all a nightmare or a drunken stupor.

The judge had paused. He made a quiet inquiry. A former member of a famous opera company known all over the country was awaiting trial for forgery. It was he who was singing in his cell.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idv3dceeko9">Meantime the song went on, and every man in the line showed emotion. One or two dropped on their knees; one boy at the end of the line, after a desperate effort at self-control, leaned against the wall, buried his face against his folded arms, and sobbed, &#x201C;Oh, mother, mother.&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id7ih47jest">The sobs, cutting to the very heart the men who heard, and the song, still welling its way through the court-room, blended in the hush. At length one man protested. &#x201C;Judge,&#x201D; said he, &#x201C;have we got to submit to this? We&#x2019;re here to take our punishment, but this&#x2014;&#x201D; He, too, began to sob.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idq9q2xatfh">It was impossible to proceed with the business of the court; yet the court gave no order to stop the song. The police sergeant, after an effort to keep the men in line, stepped back and waited with the rest. The song moved on to its climax:</p><p class="Verse1Vrs1" id="idxk54y9bjr">&#x201C;Jerusalem, Jerusalem!</p><p class="Verse1Vrs1" id="idvrhhdhl3d">Sing, for the night is o&#x2019;er!</p><p class="Verse1Vrs1" id="idnhlwlu80h">Hosanna, in the highest!</p><p class="Verse1Vrs1" id="ide9vua90im">Hosanna, for evermore!&#x201D;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id9ud2oxtn1">In an ecstasy of melody the last words rang out, and then there was silence. The judge looked into the faces of the men before him. There was not one who was not touched by the song; not one in whom some better impulse was not stirred. He did not call the cases singly&#x2014;a kind word of advice, and he dismissed them all. No man was fined or sentenced to the work-house that morning.

He has become a slave to the desire for wealth; he is too busy to enjoy life and too selfish to wish to help others enjoy it.

Herron had in mind the law upon which the Golden Rule philosophy is based when he said:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id53n5wx5et">&#x201C;We have talked much of the brotherhood to come; but brotherhood has always been the fact of our life, long before it became a modern and inspired sentiment. Only we have been brothers in slavery and torment, brothers in ignorance and its perdition, brothers in disease, and war, and want, brothers in prostitution and hypocrisy. What happens to one of us sooner or later happens to all; we have always been unescapably involved in common destiny. The world constantly tends to the level of the downmost man in it; and that downmost man is the world&#x2019;s real ruler, hugging it close to his bosom, dragging it down to his death. You do not think so, but it is true, and it ought to be true. For if there were some way by which some of us could get free, apart from others, if there were some way by which some of us could have heaven while others had hell, if there were some way by which part of the world could escape some form of the blight and peril and misery of disinherited labor, then indeed would our world be lost and damned; but since men have never been able to separate themselves from one another&#x2019;s woes and wrongs, since history is fairly stricken with the lesson that we cannot escape brotherhood of some kind, since the whole of life is teaching us that we are hourly choosing between brotherhood in suffering and brotherhood in good, it remains for us to choose the brotherhood of a co-operative world, with all its fruits thereof&#x2014;the fruits of <span class="itali">love</span> and <span class="itali">liberty&#x201D;</span></p><p class="BOX-ABOX-A" id="idq4w4spa99">BOX-A</p><p class="Epigraph-Non-VerseEpi" id="idm1ydjwz4u">No idle person is ever safe, whether he be rich or poor, white or black, educated or illiterate.</p><p class="Epigraph-SourceEpisrc" id="idafcnqozmy">&#x2014;Booker T.

This great universal call for co-operative effort is taking on many forms, not the least important of which are the Rotary Clubs, the Kiwanis Clubs, the Lions Clubs and the many other luncheon clubs which bring men together in a spirit of friendly intercourse, for these clubs mark the beginning of an age of friendly competition in business. The next step will be a closer alliance of all such clubs in an out-and-out spirit of friendly co-operation.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idsmui1pmmj">The attempt by Woodrow Wilson and his contemporaries to establish the League of Nations, followed by the efforts of Warren G. Harding to give footing to the same cause under the name of the World Court, marked the first attempt in the history of the world to make the Golden Rule effective as a common meeting ground for the nations of the world.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2iyqew85u">There is no escape from the fact that the world has awakened to the truth in George D. Herron&#x2019;s statement that &#x201C;we are hourly choosing between brotherhood in suffering and brotherhood in good.&#x201D; The world war has taught us&#x2014;nay, forced upon us&#x2014;the truth that a part of the world cannot suffer without injury to the whole world. These facts are called to your attention, not in the nature of a preachment on morality, but for the purpose of directing your attention to the underlying law through which these changes are being brought about. For more than four thousand years the world has been thinking about the Golden Rule philosophy, and that <span class="itali">thought</span> is now becoming transformed into realization of the benefits that accrue to those who apply it.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idzhqaqp06f">Still mindful of the fact that the student of this course is interested in a material success that can be measured by bank balances, it seems appropriate to suggest here that all who will may profit by shaping their business philosophy to conform with this sweeping change toward co-operation which is taking place all over the world.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idxgc8m31og">If you can grasp the significance of the tremendous change that has come over the world since the close of the world war, and if you can interpret the meaning of all the luncheon clubs and other similar gatherings which bring men and women together in a spirit of friendly co-operation, surely your imagination will suggest to you the fact that this is an opportune time to profit by adopting this spirit of friendly co-operation as the basis of your own business or professional philosophy.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ida1kho6og4">Stated conversely, it must be obvious to all who make any pretense of thinking accurately, that the time is at hand when failure to adopt the Golden Rule as the foundation of one&#x2019;s business or professional philosophy is the equivalent of economic suicide.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idgqq43ep8t">Perhaps you have wondered why the subject of <span class="itali">honesty</span> has not been mentioned in this course, as a prerequisite to <span class="itali">success,</span> and, if so, the answer will be found in this lesson. The Golden Rule philosophy, when rightly understood and applied, makes dishonesty impossible. It does more than this&#x2014;it makes impossible all the other destructive qualities such as selfishness, greed, envy, bigotry, hatred and malice.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idizx2ve7zs">When you apply the Golden Rule, you become, at one and the same time, both the judge and the judged&#x2014;the accused and the accuser. This places one in a position in which <span class="itali">honesty </span>begins in one&#x2019;s own heart, toward one&#x2019;s self, and extends to all others with equal effect. <span class="itali">Honesty</span> based upon the Golden Rule is not the brand of honesty which recognizes nothing but the question of expediency.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idei45jabd8">It is no credit to be honest, when honesty is obviously the most <span class="itali">profitable</span> policy, lest one lose a good customer or a valuable client or be sent to jail for trickery. But when honesty means either a temporary or a permanent material loss, then it becomes an <span class="itali">honor</span> of the highest degree to all who practice it. Such honesty has its appropriate reward in the accumulated power of character and reputation enjoyed by all who deserve it.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idru3c6383u">Those who understand and apply the Golden Rule philosophy are always scrupulously honest, not alone out of their desire to be just with others, but because of their desire to be just with themselves.

Those who understand the law through which the Golden Rule operates would poison their own drinking water as quickly as they would indulge in acts of injustice to others, for they know that such injustice starts a chain of causation that will not only bring them physical suffering, but will destroy their characters, stain for ill their reputations and render impossible the attainment of enduring success.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idbhnwzmx6c">The law through which the Golden Rule philosophy operates is none other than the law through which the principle of Auto-suggestion operates.

Everywhere we see the evolutionary forces working great changes in the method and manner of living, and rearranging the relationships between men, in the ordinary pursuit of life, liberty and a living.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idgq3aznxek">This is an age of organized effort. On every hand we see evidence that organization is the basis of all financial success, and while other factors than that of organization enter into the attainment of success, this factor is still one of major importance.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idicaixtdkd">This industrial age has created two comparatively new terms. One is called &#x201C;capital&#x201D; and the other &#x201C;labor.&#x201D; Capital and labor constitute the main wheels in the machinery of organized effort. These two great forces enjoy success in exact ratio to the extent that both understand and apply the Golden Rule philosophy. Despite this fact, however, harmony between these two forces does not always prevail, thanks to the destroyers of confidence who make a living by sowing the seed of dissension and stirring up strife between employers and employees.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idigyvzca90">During the past fifteen years I have devoted considerable time to the study of the causes of disagreement between employers and employees. Also, I have gathered much information on this subject from other men who, likewise, have been studying this problem.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idiwpk9g1pd">There is but one solution which will, if understood by all concerned, bring harmony out of chaos and establish a perfect working relationship between capital and labor. The remedy is no invention of mine. It is based upon a great universal law of Nature. This remedy has been well stated by one of the great men of this generation, in the following words:</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idausne8bfn">&#x201C;The question we propose to consider is exciting deep interest at the present time, but no more than its importance demands. It is one of the hopeful signs of the times that these subjects of vital interest to human happiness are constantly coming up for a hearing, are engaging the attention of the wisest men, and stirring the minds of all classes of people. The wide prevalence of this movement shows that a new life is beating in the heart of humanity, operating upon their faculties like the warm breath of spring upon the frozen ground and the dormant germs of the plant. It will make a great stir, it will break up many frozen and dead forms, it will produce great and, in some cases, it may be, destructive changes, but it announces the blossoming of new hopes, and the coming of new harvests for the supply of human wants and the means of greater happiness. There is great need of wisdom to guide the new forces coming into action. Every man is under the most solemn obligation to do his part in forming a correct public opinion and giving wise direction to popular will.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idi2b4j509y">&#x201C;The only solution for the problems of labor, of want, of abundance, of suffering and sorrow can only be found by regarding them from a moral and spiritual point of view. They must be seen and examined in a light that is not of themselves. <span class="itali">The true relations of labor and capital can never be discovered by human selfishness.</span> They must be viewed from a higher purpose than wages or the accumulation of wealth. They must be regarded from their bearing upon the purposes for which man was created. It is from this point of view I propose to consider the subject before us.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idd4xe9cult">&#x201C;Capital and labor are essential to each other. Their interests are so bound together that they cannot be separated. In civilized and enlightened communities they are mutually dependent. If there is any difference, capital is more dependent upon labor than labor upon capital. Life can be sustained without capital. Animals, with a few exceptions, have no property, and take no anxious thought for the morrow, and our Lord commends them to our notice as examples worthy of imitation. &#x2018;Behold the fowls of the air,&#x2019; He says, &#x2018;for they sow not, neither do they reap nor gather into barns, yet your heavenly Father feedeth them.&#x2019; The savages live without capital. Indeed, the great mass of human beings live by their labor from day to day, from hand to mouth. But no man can live upon his wealth. He cannot eat his gold and silver; he cannot clothe himself with deeds and certificates of stock. Capital can do nothing without labor, <span class="itali">and its only value consists in its power to purchase labor or its results.</span> It is itself the product of labor. It has no occasion, therefore, to assume an importance that does not belong to it. Absolutely dependent, however, as it is upon labor for its value, it is an essential factor in human progress.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2rl06jutp">&#x201C;The moment man begins to rise from a savage and comparatively independent state to a civilized and dependent one, capital becomes necessary. Men come into more intimate relations with one another. Instead of each one doing everything, men begin to devote themselves to special employments, and to depend upon others to provide many things for them while they engage in some special occupation. In this way labor becomes diversified. One man works in iron, another in wood; one manufactures cloth, another makes it into garments; some raise food to feed those who build houses and manufacture implements of husbandry. This necessitates a system of exchanges, and to facilitate exchanges roads must be made, and men must be employed to make them. As population increases and necessities multiply, the business of exchange becomes enlarged, until we have immense manufactories, railroads girding the earth with iron bands, steamships plowing every sea, and a multitude of men who cannot raise bread or make a garment, or do anything directly for the supply of their own wants.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id5vwc0xsfa">&#x201C;Now, we can see how we become more dependent upon others as our wants are multiplied and civilization advances. Each one works in his special employment, does better work, because he can devote his whole thought and time to a form of use for which he is specially fitted, and contributes more largely to the public good. While he is working for others, all others are working for him. Every member of the community is working for the whole body, and the whole body for every member. This is the law of perfect life, a law which rules everywhere in the material body. Every man who is engaged in any employment useful to body or mind is a philanthropist, a public benefactor, whether he raises corn on the prairie, cotton in Texas or India, mines coal in the chambers of the earth, or feeds it to engines in the hold of a steamship. If selfishness did not pervert and blast human motives, all men and women would be fulfilling the law of charity while engaged in their daily employment.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id68tq0rjqj">&#x201C;To carry on this vast system of exchanges, to place the forest and the farm, the factory and the mine side by side, and deliver the products of all climes at every door, requires immense capital. One man cannot work his farm or factory, and build a railroad or a line of steamships. As raindrops acting singly cannot drive a mill or supply steam for an engine, but, collected in a vast reservoir, become the resistless power of Niagara, or the force which drives the engine and steamship like mighty shuttles from mountain to seacoast and from shore to shore, so a few dollars in a multitude of pockets are powerless to provide the means for these vast operations, but combined they move the world.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idmtt7e1xed">&#x201C;Capital is a friend of labor and essential to its economical exercise and just reward. It can be, and often is, a terrible enemy, when employed for selfish purposes alone; but the great mass of it is more friendly to human happiness than is generally supposed. It cannot be employed without in some way, either directly or indirectly, helping the laborer. We think of the evils we suffer, but allow the good we enjoy to pass unnoticed. We think of the evils that larger means would relieve and the comforts they would provide, but overlook the blessings we enjoy that would have been impossible without large accumulations of capital. It is the part of wisdom to form a just estimate of the good we receive as well as the evils we suffer.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id2y1vjrsz5">&#x201C;It is a common saying at the present time, that the rich are growing richer and the poor poorer; but when all man&#x2019;s possessions are taken into the account there are good reasons for doubting this assertion. It is true that the rich are growing richer. It is also true that the condition of the laborer is constantly improving. <span class="itali">The common laborer has conveniences and comforts which princes could not command a century ago.</span> He is better clothed, has a greater variety and abundance of food, lives in a more comfortable dwelling, and has many more conveniences for the conduct of domestic affairs and the prosecution of labor than money could purchase but a few years ago. An emperor could not travel with the ease, the comfort, and the swiftness that the common laborer can today. He may think that he stands alone, with no one to help. But, in truth, he has an immense retinue of servants constantly waiting upon him, ready and anxious to do his bidding. It requires a vast army of men and an immense outlay of capital to provide a common dinner, such as every man and woman, with few exceptions, has enjoyed today.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ide2sjcstr8">&#x201C;Think of the vast combination of means and men and forces necessary to provide even a frugal meal. The Chinaman raises your tea, the Brazilian your coffee, the East Indian your spices, the Cuban your sugar, the farmer upon the western prairies your bread and possibly your beef, the gardener your vegetables, the dairyman your butter and milk; the miner has dug from the hills the coal with which your food was cooked and your house was warmed, the cabinet-maker has provided you with chairs and tables, the cutler with knives and forks, the potter with dishes, the Irishman has made your table-cloth, the butcher has dressed your meat, the miller your flour.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id52yyf96j1">&#x201C;But these various articles of food, and the means of preparing and serving them, were produced at immense distances from you and from one another. Oceans had to be traversed, hills leveled, valleys filled, and mountains tunneled, ships must be built, railways constructed, and a vast army of men instructed and employed in every mechanical art before the materials for your dinner could be prepared and served. There must also be men to collect these materials, to buy and sell and distribute them. Everyone stands in his own place and does his own work, and receives his wages. But he is none the less working for you, and serving you as truly and effectively as he would be if he were in your special employment and received his wages from your hand. In the light of these facts, which everyone must acknowledge, we may be able to see more clearly the truth, that every man and woman who does useful work is a public benefactor, and the thought of it and the purpose of it will ennoble the labor and the laborer. We are all bound together by common ties. The rich and the poor, the learned and the ignorant, the strong and the weak, are woven together in one social and civic web. Harm to one is harm to all; help to one is help to all.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idgynr5zbjs">&#x201C;You see what a vast army of servants it requires to provide your dinner. Do you not see that it demands a corresponding amount of capital to provide and keep this complicated machinery in motion? And do you not see that every man, woman and child is enjoying the benefit of it? How could we get our coal, our meat, our flour, our tea and coffee, sugar and rice? The laborer cannot build ships and sail them and support himself while doing it. <span class="itali">The farmer cannot leave his farm and take his produce to the market. The miner cannot mine and transport his coal.</span> The farmer in Kansas may be burning corn today to cook his food and warm his dwelling, and the miner may be hungry for the bread which the corn would supply, because they cannot exchange the fruits of their labor. Every acre of land, every forest and mine has been increased in value by railways and steamboats, and the comforts of life and the means of social and intellectual culture have been carried to the most inaccessible places.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id629s2q0ef">&#x201C;But the benefits of capital are not limited to supplying present wants and comforts. It opens new avenues for labor. It diversifies it and gives a wider field to everyone to do the kind of work for which he is best fitted by natural taste and genius. The number of employments created by railways, steamships, telegraph, and manufactories by machinery can hardly be estimated. Capital is also largely invested in supplying the means of intellectual and spiritual culture. Books are multiplied at constantly diminishing prices, and the best thought of the world, by means of our great publishing houses, is made accessible to the humblest workman. There is no better example of the benefits the common laborer derives from capital than the daily newspaper. For two or three cents the history of the world for twenty-four hours is brought to every door. The laborer, while riding to or from his work in a comfortable car, can visit all parts of the known world and get a truer idea of the events of the day than he could if he were bodily present. A battle in China or Africa, an earthquake in Spain, a dynamite explosion in London, a debate in Congress, the movements of men in public and private life for the suppression of vice, for enlightening the ignorant, helping the needy, and improving the people generally; are spread before him in a small compass, and bring him into contact and on equality, in regard to the world&#x2019;s history, with kings and queens, with saints and sages, and people in every condition in life. <span class="itali">Do you ever think,</span> while reading the morning paper, how many men have been running on your errands, collecting intelligence for you from all parts of the earth, and putting it into a form convenient for your use? It required the investment of millions of money and the employment of thousands of men to produce that paper and leave it at your door. And what did all this service cost you? A few cents.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idnu9rr871k">&#x201C;These are examples of the benefits which everyone derives from capital, benefits which could not be obtained without vast expenditures of money; benefits which come to us without our care and lay their blessings at our feet. Capital cannot be invested in any useful production without blessing a multitude of people. It sets the machinery of life in motion, it multiplies employment; it places the product of all climes at every door, it draws the people of all nations together; brings mind in contact with mind, and gives to every man and woman a large and valuable share of the product. These are facts which it would be well for everyone, however poor he may be, to consider.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id3xfot448d">&#x201C;If capital is such a blessing to labor; if it can only be brought into use by labor, and derives all its value from it, how can there be any conflict between them? There could be none if both the capitalist and laborer acted from humane and Christian principles. But they do not. They are governed by inhuman and unchristian principles. Each party seeks to get the largest returns for the least service. Capital desires larger profits, labor higher wages. The interests of the capitalist and the laborer come into direct collision. In this warfare capital has great advantages, and has been prompt to take them. It has demanded and taken the lion&#x2019;s share of the profits. It has despised the servant that enriched it. It has regarded the laborer as a menial, a slave, whose rights and happiness it was not bound to respect. It influences legislators to enact laws in its favor, subsidizes governments and wields its power for its own advantage. Capital has been a lord and labor a servant. While the servant remained docile and obedient, content with such compensation as its lord chose to give, there was no conflict. But labor is rising from a servile, submissive, and hopeless condition. It has acquired strength and intelligence; has gained the idea that it has rights that ought to be respected, and begins to assert and combine to support them.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id0gfyo5hu9">&#x201C;Each party in this warfare regards the subject from its own selfish interests. The capitalist supposes that gain to labor is loss to him, and that he must look to his own interests first; that the cheaper the labor the larger his gains. Consequently it is for his interest to keep the price as low as possible. On the contrary, the laborer thinks that he loses what the capitalist gains, and, consequently, that it is for his interest to get as large wages as possible. From these opposite points of view their interests appear to be directly hostile. What one party gains the other loses; hence the conflict. Both are acting from selfish motives, and, consequently, must be wrong. Both parties see only half of the truth, and, mistaking that for the whole of it, they fall into a mistake ruinous to both. Each one stands on his own ground, and regards the subject wholly from his point of view and in the misleading light of his own selfishness. Passion inflames the mind and blinds the understanding; and when passion is aroused men will sacrifice their own interests to injure others, and both will suffer loss. They will wage continual warfare against each other; they will resort to all devices, and take advantage of every necessity to win a victory. Capital tries to starve the laborer into submission, like a beleaguered city; and hunger and want are most powerful weapons. Labor sullenly resists, and tries to destroy the value of capital by rendering it unproductive. If necessity or interest compels a truce, it is a sullen one, and maintained with the purpose of renewing hostilities as soon as there is any prospect of success. Thus laborers and capitalists confront each other like two armed hosts, ready at any time to renew the conflict. <span class="itali">It will be renewed, without doubt, and continued with varying success until both parties discover that they are mistaken, that their interests are mutual, and can only be secured to the fullest extent by co-operation and giving to each the reward it deserves.</span> The capitalist and the laborer must clasp hands across the bottomless pit into which so much wealth and work has been cast.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idt89b4phdz">&#x201C;How this reconciliation is to be effected is a question that is occupying the minds of many wise and good men on both sides at the present time. Wise and impartial legislation will, no doubt, be an important agent in restraining blind passion and protecting all classes from insatiable greed; and it is the duty of every man to use his best endeavors to secure such legislation both in state and national governments. Organizations of laborers for protecting their own rights and securing a better reward for their labor, will have a great influence. That influence will continue to increase as their temper becomes normal and firm, and their demands are based <span class="itali">on justice and humanity.</span> Violence and threats will effect no good. Dynamite, whether in the form of explosives or the more destructive force of fierce and reckless passion, will heal no wounds nor subdue any hostile feeling. Arbitration is, doubtless, the wisest and most practicable means now available to bring about amicable relations between these hostile parties and secure justice to both. Giving the laborer a share in the profits of the business has worked well in some cases, but it is attended with great practical difficulties which require more wisdom, self-control and genuine regard for the common interests of both parties than often can be found. Many devices may have a partial and temporary effect. But no permanent progress can be made in settling this conflict without restraining and finally removing its cause.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idtqn5ekhxt">&#x201C;Its real central cause is an inordinate love of self and the world, and that cause will continue to operate as long as it exists. It may be restrained and moderated, but it will assert itself when occasion offers. Every wise man must, therefore, seek to remove the cause, and as far as he can do it he will control effects. Purify the fountain, and you make the whole stream pure and wholesome.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idprae3x267">&#x201C;There is a principle of universal influence that must underlie and guide every successful effort to bring these two great factors of human good which now confront each other with hostile purpose, into harmony. It is no invention or discovery of mine. It embodies a higher than human wisdom. It is not difficult to understand or apply. The child can comprehend it and act according to it. It is universal in its application, and wholly useful in its effects. It will lighten the burdens of labor and increase its rewards. It will give security to capital and make it more productive. It is simply the Golden Rule, embodied in these words: <span class="itali">&#x2018;Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets</span>.&#x2019;</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idt9t0lbifc">&#x201C;Before proceeding to apply this principle to the case in hand, let me call your special attention to it. It is a very remarkable law of human life which seems to have been generally overlooked by statesmen, philosophers and religious teachers. This rule embodies the whole of religion; it comprises all the precepts, commandments, and means of the future triumphs of good over evil, of truth over error, and the peace and happiness of men, foretold in the glorious visions of the prophets. Mark the words. It does not merely say that it is a wise rule; that it accords with the principles of the Divine order revealed in the law and the prophets. <span class="itali">It embodies them all; it &#x2018;IS the law and the prophets.&#x2019;</span> It comprises love to God. It says we should regard Him as we desire to have Him regard us; that we should do to Him as we wish to have Him do to us. If we desire to have Him love us with all His heart, with all His soul, with all His mind, and with all His strength, we must love Him in the same manner. If we desire to have our neighbor love us as he loves himself, we must love him as we love ourself. Here, then, is the universal and Divine law of human service and fellowship. It is not a precept of human wisdom; it has its origin in the Divine nature, and its embodiment in human nature. Now, let us apply it to the conflict between labor and capital.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="ido7oihqmeh">&#x201C;You are a capitalist. Your money is invested in manufactures, in land, in mines, in merchandise, railways, and ships, or you loan it to others on interest. You employ, directly or indirectly, men to use your capital. You cannot come to a just conclusion concerning your rights and duties and privileges by looking wholly at your own gains. The glitter of the silver and gold will exercise so potent a spell over your mind that it will blind you to everything else. You can see no interest but your own. The laborer is not known or regarded as a man who has any interests you are bound to regard. You see him only as your slave, your tool, your means of adding to your wealth. In this light he is a friend so far as he serves you, an enemy so far as he does not. But change your point of view. Put yourself in his place; put him in your place. How would you like to have him treat you if you were in his place? Perhaps you have been there. In all probability you have, for the capitalist today was the laborer yesterday, and the laborer today will be the employer tomorrow. You know from lively and painful experience how you would like to be treated. Would you like to be regarded as a mere tool? As a means of enriching another? Would you like to have your wages kept down to the bare necessities of life? Would you like to be regarded with indifference and treated with brutality? Would you like to have your blood, your strength, your soul coined into dollars for the benefit of another? These questions are easy to answer. Everyone knows that he would rejoice to be treated kindly, to have his interests regarded, his rights recognized and protected. Everyone knows that such regard awakens a response in his own heart. Kindness begets kindness; respect awakens respect. Put yourself in his place. Imagine that you are dealing with yourself, and you will have no difficulty in deciding whether you should give the screw another turn, that you may wring a penny more from the muscles of the worker, or relax its pressure, and, if possible, add something to his wages, and give him respect for his service. Do to him as you would have him do to you in changed conditions.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idt4nl8jllu">&#x201C;You are a laborer. You receive a certain sum for a day&#x2019;s work. Put yourself in the place of your employer. How would you like to have the men you employed work for you? Would you think it right that they should regard you as their enemy? Would you think it honest in them to slight their work, <span class="itali">to do as little and to get as much as possible?</span> If you had a large contract which must be completed at a fixed time or you would suffer great loss, would you like to have your workmen take advantage of your necessity to compel an increase of their wages? Would you think it right and wise in them to interfere with you in the management of your business? To dictate whom you should employ, and on what terms you should employ them? Would you not rather have them do honest work in a kind and good spirit? Would you not be much more disposed to look to their interests, to lighten their labor, to increase their wages when you could afford to do so, and look after the welfare of their families, when you found that they regarded yours? I know that it would be so. It is true that men are selfish, and that some men are so mean and contracted in spirit that they cannot see any interest but their own; whose hearts, not made of flesh but of silver and gold, are so hard that they are not touched by any human feeling, and care not how much others suffer if they can make a cent by it. But they are the exception, not the rule. We are influenced by the regard and devotion of others to our interests. The laborer who knows that his employer feels kindly toward him, desires to treat him justly and to regard his good, will do better work and more of it, and will be disposed to look to his employer&#x2019;s interests as well as his own.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idy12bknnvf">&#x201C;I am well aware that many will think this Divine and humane law of doing to others as we would have them do to us, is impracticable in this selfish and worldly age. If both parties would be governed by it, everyone can see how happy would be the results. But, it will be said, they will not. The laborer will not work unless compelled by want. He will take advantage of every necessity. As soon as he gains a little independence of his employer he becomes proud, arrogant and hostile. The employer will seize upon every means to keep the workmen dependent upon him, and to make as much out of them as possible. Every inch of ground which labor yields capital will occupy and intrench itself in it, and from its vantage bring the laborer into greater dependence and more abject submission. But this is a mistake. The history of the world testifies that when the minds of men are not embittered by intense hostility and their feelings outraged by cruel wrongs, they are ready to listen to calm, disinterested and judicious counsel. A man who employed a large number of laborers in mining coal told me that he had never known an instance to fail of a calm and candid response when he had appealed to honorable motives, as a man to man, both of whom acknowledged a common humanity. There is a recent and most notable instance in this city of the happy effect of calm, disinterested and judicious counsel in settling difficulties between employers and workmen that were disastrous to both.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="id939g5b3j0">&#x201C;When the mind is inflamed by passion men will not listen to reason. They become blind to their own interests and regardless of the interests of others. <span class="itali">Difficulties are never settled while passion rages. They are never settled by conflict. One party may be subdued by power; but the sense of wrong will remain; the fire of passion will slumber ready to break out again on the first occasion.</span> But let the laborer or the capitalist feel assured that the other party has no wish to take any advantage, that there is a sincere desire and determination on both sides to be just and pay due regard to their common interests, and all the conflict between them would cease, as the wild waves of the ocean sink to calm when the winds are at rest. The laborer and the capitalist have a mutual and common interest. Neither can permanently prosper without the prosperity of the other. They are parts of one body. If labor is the arm, capital is the blood. Devitalize or waste the blood, and the arm loses its power. Destroy the arm, and the blood is useless. Let each care for the other, and both are benefited. <span class="itali">Let each take the Golden Rule as a guide,</span> and all cause of hostility will be removed, all conflict will cease, and they will go hand in hand to do their work and reap their just reward.&#x201D;</p><p class="Blank-Space-BreakBsbrk" id="idju2yn6n11">[blank]</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idmpp8kfk5v">If you have mastered the fundamentals upon which this lesson is based, you understand why it is that no public speaker can move his audience or convince men of his argument unless he, himself, believes that which he is saying.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idfqibk1eyj">You also understand why no salesman can convince his prospective purchaser unless he has first convinced himself of the merits of his goods.</p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idfcnyirreh">Throughout this entire course one particular principle has been emphasized for the purpose of illustrating the truth that every personality is the sum total of the individual&#x2019;s <span class="itali">thoughts </span>and <span class="itali">acts</span>&#x2014;that we come to resemble the nature of our dominating <span class="itali">thoughts.</span></p><p class="Body-TextTx" id="idxlymmiu7f"><span class="itali">Thought</span> is the only power that can systematically organize, accumulate and assemble facts and materials according to a definite plan.

He worked as a secretary, a &#x201C;mountain reporter&#x201D; for a local newspaper, the manager of a coal mine and a lumber yard, and attended law school, before he began working as a journalist for <span class="itali">Bob Taylor&#x2019;s Magazine</span>&#x2014;a job that led to his meeting steel magnate Andrew Carnegie, which changed the course of his life. Carnegie believed success could be distilled into principles that any person could follow, and urged Hill to interview the greatest industrialists of the era in order to discover these principles. Hill took on the challenge, which lasted twenty years and formed the building block for <span class="itali">Think and Grow Rich.</span> This wealth-building classic and all-time bestseller of its kind has sold more than 15 million copies worldwide. Hill devoted the remainder of his life to discovering and refining the principles of success. After a long and rich career as an author, magazine publisher, lecturer, and consultant to business leaders, the motivational pioneer died in 1970 in South Carolina.</p><section data-type="appendix" class="footnotes"><div class="footnote" data-noteref="1"><span class="FootnoteText"><span class="FootnoteReference">*</span> The following figures are reflective of the author&#x2019;s era.</span></div><div class="footnote" data-noteref="2"><span class="FootnoteText"><span class="FootnoteReference"></span> Using Symbol for Custom note mark</span></div><div class="footnote" data-noteref="3"><span class="FootnoteText"><span class="FootnoteReference">*</span> Reprinted by courtesy of <span class="itali">The</span> <span class="itali">American</span> <span class="itali">Magazine.</span> Copyright, The Crowell Publishing Company, 1927.</span></div><div class="footnote" data-noteref="4"><span class="FootnoteText"><span class="FootnoteReference">*</span> Judge T.
